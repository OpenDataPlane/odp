 * Traffic management on packet output.
 *
 * This file forms a simple interface for creating, configuring and using
 * Traffic Management (TM) subsystems.  By TM subsystem it is meant a general
 * packet scheduling system that accepts packets from input queues and applies
 * strict priority scheduling, weighted fair queueing scheduling and/or
 * bandwidth controls to decide which input packet should be chosen as the
 * next output packet and when this output packet can be sent onwards.
 *
 * A given platform supporting this TM API could support one or more pure
 * hardware based packet scheduling systems, one or more pure software
 * based systems or one or more hybrid systems - where because of
 * hardware constraints some of the packet scheduling is done in hardware
 * and some is done in software.  In addition, there may also be additional
 * APIs beyond those described here for (a) controlling advanced capabilities
 * supported by specific hardware, software or hybrid subsystems or (b)
 * dealing with constraints and limitations of specific implementations.
