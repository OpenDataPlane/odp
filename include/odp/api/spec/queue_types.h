 * freedom guarantees, but a suspending thread may block the other threads for
 * the entire time it remains suspended (infinitely if crashed).
 * On the contrary, actual non-blocking levels provide guarantees of progress:
 *
 * ODP_NONBLOCKING_LF:  A non-blocking and lock-free implementation guarantees
 *                      that at least one of the threads successfully completes
 *                      its operations, regardless of what other threads do.
 *                      Application progress is guaranteed, but individual
 *                      threads may starve while trying to execute their
 *                      operations on the shared resource.
 *
 * ODP_NONBLOCKING_WF:  A non-blocking and wait-free implementation guarantees
 *                      application progress with starvation freedom. All
 *                      threads are guaranteed to complete their operations in
 *                      a bounded number of steps, regardless of what other
 *                      threads do.
 *
 * Non-blocking levels are listed from the weakest to the strongest guarantee of
 * block freedom. Performance of a non-blocking implementation may be lower than
 * the blocking one. Non-blocking guarantees are important e.g. for real-time
 * applications when real-time and non real-time threads share a resource.
