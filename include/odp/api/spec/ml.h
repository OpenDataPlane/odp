 * Machine Learning (ML) offload
 * @{
 *
 * <b> ML API call sequence </b>
 *
 * Before ML offload can be used, it must be configured with an odp_ml_config() call. An application
 * fills in configuration parameters to describe its intended ML offload usage. The parameter
 * values may help ODP implementation to optimize memory and other HW resource usage. The
 * application may use odp_ml_capability() to check ML capabilities both before and after the
 * configuration step.
 *
 * After configuration, an ML model binary is passed with other parameters to odp_ml_model_create()
 * call which checks and prepares the model for usage. The application may use odp_ml_model_info(),
 * odp_ml_model_input_info() and odp_ml_model_output_info() calls to check model input and output
 * data formats. Before the application can use the model for inference, it loads the model with
 * an odp_ml_model_load() or odp_ml_model_load_start() call. After a successful load, the
 * application may use e.g. odp_ml_run() or odp_ml_run_start() to perform inferences.
 *
 * When all previously started inference operations are complete, application uses
 * odp_ml_model_unload() or odp_ml_model_unload_start() to unload the model. After a successful
 * unload, the model may be destroyed with an odp_ml_model_destroy() call, or loaded again.
 *
 * <b> Completion identifiers </b>
 *
 * Completion identifiers are used with ML operations in asynchronous poll mode
 * (#ODP_ML_COMPL_MODE_POLL). Application declares the maximum identifier value it will
 * use per model with odp_ml_model_param_t.max_compl_id parameter. It cannot exceed
 * the implementation capability of odp_ml_capability_t.max_compl_id. Completion identifier
 * values are model specific. The same value can be used simultaneously with two different
 * models, but cannot be used simultaneously in two ML operations on the same model. A value may be
 * reused for the next ML operation (on the same model) only after the previous operation is
 * complete. Within those limitations, application may use/reuse completion identifier
 * values from 0 to max_compl_id range freely.
 */
