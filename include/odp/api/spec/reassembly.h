/**
 * Fragment reassembly configuration
 *
 * Configure inline fragment reassembly offload support. Fragment
 * reassembly offload can be enabled in IPSEC and PKTIN operations.
 *
 * When the offload is enabled, fragments will be delayed for a specified time
 * period to allow reassembly.
 *
 * Reassembly result will be delivered to the application through an ODP packet
 * with reassembly metadata. odp_packet_reass_status() can be used to query if
 * reassembly has been attempted and if reassembly was successfully completed.
 *
 * In case of successful reassembly, the reassembled packet is delivered
 * to the receiver as a regular ODP packet as if the reassembled packet
 * was received as such. When reassembly is enabled in pktio, it will be
 * attempted before other offloads such as packet parsing, inline IPsec and
 * classification.
 *
 * In case of failed reassembly, the result is delivered to the application
 * as a special packet that does not contain valid packet data. Such a
 * packet can be used to get information of the incomplete reassembly
 * so that the application can try to retry or continue the reassembly.
 * See odp_packet_reass_partial_state().
 *
 * Reassembly may not complete if not all fragments were received in time but
 * also for packet parsing difficulty, fragment overlap, resource shortage or
 * other reasons. In such cases, application may receive packets with reassembly
 * status as either ``ODP_PACKET_REASS_NONE`` or ``ODP_PACKET_REASS_INCOMPLETE``.
 *
 * This structure is used only for configuration, not for capability
 * query even though it is indirectly contained in odp_pktio_capability_t.
 * The content of odp_pktio_capability_t.config.reassembly written by
 * odp_pktio_capability() is undefined. Reassembly capabilities of a pktio
 * can be checked through odp_pktio_capability_t.reassembly.
 *
 * @see odp_packet_reass_status(), odp_packet_reass_partial_state()
