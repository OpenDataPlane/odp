1. Intro

The IPsec API example application "odp_ipsec_api" functions as a simple L3 IPv4
router which supports IPsec AH and ESP protocols in both transmit and receive
directions. AH and ESP protocols are not supported simultaneously.

With ESP, the application supports 3DES and NULL encryption algorithms, with
NULL authentication. With AH, HMAC-MD5 or HMAC-SHA-256 integrity algorithms are
supported.

2. Prerequisites

  2.1 SSL development libraries

Development has been done to this point with the openssl-devel libraries,
the makefile specifically links with "-lcrypto".

3. Topology

The following test topology was used for development. Each of the VMs
is running Fedora 32. Sanity testing consists of pinging VM2 from VM0
such that the packets traverse VM1. Packets between VM1 and VM2 are
IPsec AH or ESP encapsulated.

     VM0                            VM1 (UUT)                          VM2
+------------+                  +--------------+                  +------------+
|            |     (clear)      |              |     (crypto)     |            |
|            |      subnet      |              |      subnet      |            |

|            |                  |              |                  |            |

4. VM configurations

  4.1 VM0 configuration

VM0 has the following interface configuration:

$ cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-p7p1
DEVICE=p7p1
HWADDR=08:00:27:76:B5:E0
BOOTPROTO=static
IPADDR=192.168.111.2
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
ONBOOT=yes

In addition, static ARP and IPv4 routes must be added on VM0:

$ sudo ip route add 192.168.222.0/24 via 192.168.111.1
$ sudo arp -s 192.168.111.1 08:00:27:04:BF:8C

  4.2 VM1 configuration

For the unit under test, IP forwarding and IP tables were disabled.

VM1 has the following interface configurations:

$ cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-p7p1
DEVICE=p7p1
HWADDR=08:00:27:04:BF:8C
BOOTPROTO=static
IPADDR=192.168.111.1
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
ONBOOT=yes

$ cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-p8p1
DEVICE=p8p1
HWADDR=08:00:27:4C:55:CC
BOOTPROTO=static
IPADDR=192.168.222.1
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
ONBOOT=yes

The application is launched on VM1 with the following command:

$ sudo ./odp_ipsec_api -i p7p1,p8p1 \
-r 192.168.111.2/32,p7p1,08:00:27:76:B5:E0 \
-r 192.168.222.2/32,p8p1,08:00:27:F5:8B:DB \
-p 192.168.111.0/24,192.168.222.0/24,out,esp \
-e 192.168.111.2,192.168.222.2,3des,201,656c8523255ccc23a66c1917aa0cf30991fce83532a4b224 \
-p 192.168.222.0/24,192.168.111.0/24,in,esp \
-e 192.168.222.2,192.168.111.2,3des,301,c966199f24d095f3990a320d749056401e82b26570320292 \
-c 2 -m 0

  4.3 VM2 configuration

VM2 has the following interface configuration:

$ cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-p7p1
DEVICE=p7p1
HWADDR=08:00:27:F5:8B:DB
BOOTPROTO=static
IPADDR=192.168.222.2
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
ONBOOT=yes

In addition, static ARP and IPv4 routes must be added on VM2:

$ sudo ip route add 192.168.111.0/24 via 192.168.222.1
$ sudo arp -s 192.168.222.1 08:00:27:4C:55:CC

VM2 must be setup with an IPsec configuration complementing the configuration
used by the "odp_ipsec_api" application running on VM1. The configuration is
applied using "setkey" (provided by ipsec-tools package).

VM2 uses the following setkey configuration:

$ cat setkey_vm2.conf
# Flush the SAD and SPD
flush;
spdflush;
add 192.168.111.2 192.168.222.2 esp 0x201 -E 3des-cbc
0x656c8523255ccc23a66c1917aa0cf30991fce83532a4b224;
add 192.168.222.2 192.168.111.2 esp 0x301 -E 3des-cbc
0xc966199f24d095f3990a320d749056401e82b26570320292;
spdadd 192.168.111.2 192.168.222.2 any -P in ipsec esp/transport//require;
spdadd 192.168.222.2 192.168.111.2 any -P out ipsec esp/transport//require;

Apply the setkey configuration:
$ sudo setkey -f setkey_vm2.conf

5. Sanity Test with Real Traffic

Once all three VMs have been configured, static ARP and route entries added,
setkey configuration applied, and odp_ipsec_api application is running, VM0
should be able to ping VM2 at the 192.168.222.2 address.

At VM0 console issue the ping to VM2's address:

$ sudo ping -c 2 -i 0.1 192.168.222.2
PING 192.168.222.2 (192.168.222.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.222.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.614 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.222.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.560 ms

At VM2 console use tcpdump to observe IPsec packets:

$ sudo tcpdump -nt -i p7p1
dropped privs to tcpdump
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on enp0s9, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes

IP 192.168.222.2 > 192.168.111.2: ESP(spi=0x00000301,seq=0xf4), length 88
IP 192.168.111.2 > 192.168.222.2: ESP(spi=0x00000201,seq=0x197), length 88
IP 192.168.222.2 > 192.168.111.2: ESP(spi=0x00000301,seq=0xf5), length 88

6. Standalone Loopback Tests

Bash script files are also included to run several simple loopback tests that
do not require any packet IO. The scripts create internal "loopback" packet
interfaces.
