Files in test/validation directory are intended to be terse
checks that help ensure that the ODP implementations all perform identically
and to specification. Tests inside the validation directory shall be platform
independent.

To run valgrind on the executables do:
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure --enable-test-vald --enable-valgrind
$ make
$ cd test/<platform_name>
$ make check-valgrind

To run these tests with gdb, use the following libtool command:
$ libtool --mode=execute gdb ./<test_name>

Refer to the prerequisites section of the DEPENDENCIES file for how to
install the libtool package.
