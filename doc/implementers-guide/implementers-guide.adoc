== The include structure ==

The implementers view of the include source tree allows the common interface
definitions and documentation to be reused by all the platforms defined in the
tree, but leave the actual definitions to be defined by the specific platform.
The different ODP interfaces (api and drv) are defined and implemented using
similar structures:

<1> The specification, defining the ODP application programming interface (API)
is held in 'include/odp/api/spec/'. The ODP API is defined by a set of '.h'
files including doxygen documentation.

== ODP library naming recommendations ==

The ODP project supports two implementations ODP-linux and ODP-DPDK.  The name
of the libraries are libodp-linux and libodp-dpdk respectively. It is
recommended that other implementations follow the same schema
(odp-<implementation name>) to make the representation of the ODP
implementations uniform in a distribution.

== The validation Suite ==

ODP provides a comprehensive set of API validation tests that are intended to be
used by implementers during development and by application developers to verify
that a particular implementation meets their requirements.

The list of these tests is expected to grow as ODP grows.

The list of test executables is run by the automake test harness, when running
"make check".
Therefore, as required by this harness, each executable should return 0 on
success (tests passed), 77 on inconclusive, or any other values on failure.
The automake functionality shows a status line (PASSED/FAIL...) for each of the
ran test executables.

It is expected that ODP developers will need to run tests as early as possible
in the development cycle, before all APIs have been implemented.
Besides, although there are no APIs that are formally listed as optional, it is
also expected that there may be cases where a subset of APIs remain
unimplemented on a particular platform.
Moreover, some platforms may require specific initialization/termination code
prior/after running the standard tests.

To accommodate with these platform disparities, the ODP validation has been
divided in two distinct areas:

* The platform agnostic area,
* A platform dependent area (one per platform).

=== Platform agnostic ===

This grouping defines tests that are expected to be executable and succeed on
any platform, though possibly with very different performances, depending on the
underlying platform.
They are written in plain C code, and may only use functions defined in the
standard libC (C99) library (besides the ODP functions being tested, of course).
A free C99 specification can be found at
http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf.
No other languages (like scripting) are allowed as their usage would make
assumptions on the platform capability.

This area is located at: 'test/validation/'

The ODP API itself is ordered by module, where each module groups the set of ODP
API functions related to the same "topic".
Examples of modules includes "classification" (API functions dealing with ingress
packets classification), time (functions dealing with time, excluding timers
which have their own module), timer,...
The complete module list can be seen at:
http://docs.opendataplane.org/master/linux-generic-doxygen-html/modules.html[ODP Modules] +
Within the platform agnostic area, the tests are also grouped by modules,
matching the ODP API modules: 'test/validation/' mainly contains a list of
directories matching each module name (as defined by the doxygen "@defgroup" or
"@ingroup" statement present in each API ".h" file).

Within each of these directories, a library (called "libtest<module>.la") and
its associated ".h" file (called "<module>.h") defines all the test functions
for this module as well as few other functions to initialize, terminate, and
group the tests.
An executable called "<module>_main*", is also built. It is permissible to
generate more than one executable to cover the functionality in the test library
for the module.
These executable(s) shall call all the tests for this module. +
See <<anchor-1, Module test and naming convention>> for more details.

It is important to be aware that the tests defined for a given module
(defined in 'test/validation/<module>') are focused to test the ODP functions
belonging to this module, but are not limited to use this module's ODP functions
only: many modules needs some interaction with some other module to be tested.
The obvious illustration of this is for module "init" whose functions are
required by all tests of all other modules (as ODP needs to be initialized to
test anything else). +

There is a "Makefile.am" located at the top of the platform agnostic area. Its
role is limited to the construction of the different test libraries and the
"<module>_main*" executables. No tests are run from this area when "make check"
is performed.

==== CUnit ====

Within a given test executable CUnit is used to run the different tests. The
usage of CUnit implies the following structure:

* Tests are simple C functions.
* Tests are grouped in arrays called test suites. Each test suite can be
associated with a suite initialization/termination function(s), called by CUnit
before and after the whole suite is run.
* An array of test suites (and associated init/term functions) defines the test
registry run by the test executable.

Moreover, two extra functions can be used to initialize/terminate the test
executable (these are not part of CUnit). +
A test executable return success (0) if every test of each suite succeed.

http://cunit.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html[CUnit users guide]

[[anchor-1]]
==== Module test and naming convention ====


* Tests, i.e. C functions which are used in CUnit test suites are named:
   *<Module>_test_+++*+++* +
   where the suffix identifies the test.

* Test arrays, i.e. arrays of odp_testinfo_t, listing the test functions
  belonging to a suite, are called:
   *<Module>_suite+++[_*]+++* +
   where the possible suffix can be used if many suites are declared.

* CUnit suite init and termination functions are called:
   *<Module>+++_suite[_*]_init()+++* and *<Module>+++_suite[_*]_term()+++* respectively. +
   where the possible extra middle pattern can be used if many suites are
   declared.

* Suite arrays, i.e. arrays of odp_suiteinfo_t used in executables
  (CUnit registry) are called:
   *<Module>+++_suites[_*]+++* +
   where the possible suffix identifies the executable using it, if many.

* Main executable function(s), are called:
   *<Module>+++_main[_*]+++* +
   where the possible suffix identifies the executable, if many, using it.

* Init/term functions for the whole executable are called:
   *<Module>_init*
   *<Module>_term*

All the above symbols are part of the generated libtest<Module>.la libraries.
The generated main executable(s) (named <module>_+++main[_*]+++, where the
optional suffix is used to distinguish the executables belonging to the same
module, if many) simply call(s) the related <Module>_main+++[_*]+++ from the
library.

=== Platform specific ===

These tests are located under 'platform/<platform>/test'. There is one such area
for each platform implementing ODP.
This location will be referred as <PLATFORM_SPECIFIC> in the rest of this
document.

==== The normal case ====

If the considered platform needs no platform specific tests, this directory
simply needs to contain a single Makefile.am listing each of the executables
(named <module>_main) built from the platform agnostic area. The executables are
listed in the automake TEST variable and will therefore be run on "make check".

For the linux-generic platform, most tested modules fall into this category:
currently, the 'platform/linux-generic/test/Makefile.am' looks as follows:

[source,am]
----
include $(top_srcdir)/test/Makefile.inc
TESTS_ENVIRONMENT += TEST_DIR=${top_builddir}/test/validation

ODP_MODULES = pktio

if test_vald
TESTS = pktio/pktio_run \
	${top_builddir}/test/validation/buffer/buffer_main$(EXEEXT) \
	${top_builddir}/test/validation/classification/classification_main$(EXEEXT) \
	${top_builddir}/test/validation/cpumask/cpumask_main$(EXEEXT) \
	${top_builddir}/test/validation/crypto/crypto_main$(EXEEXT) \
	${top_builddir}/test/validation/errno/errno_main$(EXEEXT) \
	${top_builddir}/test/validation/init/init_main_ok$(EXEEXT) \
	${top_builddir}/test/validation/init/init_main_abort$(EXEEXT) \
	${top_builddir}/test/validation/init/init_main_log$(EXEEXT) \
	${top_builddir}/test/validation/packet/packet_main$(EXEEXT) \
	${top_builddir}/test/validation/pool/pool_main$(EXEEXT) \
	${top_builddir}/test/validation/queue/queue_main$(EXEEXT) \
	${top_builddir}/test/validation/random/random_main$(EXEEXT) \
	${top_builddir}/test/validation/scheduler/scheduler_main$(EXEEXT) \
	${top_builddir}/test/validation/synchronizers/synchronizers_main$(EXEEXT) \
	${top_builddir}/test/validation/thread/thread_main$(EXEEXT) \
	${top_builddir}/test/validation/time/time_main$(EXEEXT) \
	${top_builddir}/test/validation/timer/timer_main$(EXEEXT) \
	${top_builddir}/test/validation/shmem/shmem_main$(EXEEXT) \
	${top_builddir}/test/validation/system/system_main$(EXEEXT)

SUBDIRS = $(ODP_MODULES)
endif

----

With the exception for module pktio, all other modules testing just involves
calling the platform agnostic <module>_main executables (in test/validation).

==== Using other languages ====

The pktio module, above, is actually tested using a bash script. This script is
needed to set up the interfaces used by the tests. The pktio_run script
eventually calls the platform agnostic 'test/validation/pktio/pktio_main' after
setting up the interfaces needed by the tests.
Notice that the path to the script, 'pktio/pktio_run', is pointing to a file
within the <PLATFORM_SPECIFIC> tree so is private to this platform. Any
languages supported by the tested platform can be used there, as it will not
impact other platforms.
The platform "private" executables (such as this script), of course, must also
return one of the return code expected by the automake test harness
(0 for success, 77 for skipped, other values for errors).

==== Defining test wrappers ====

The pktio case above is actually using a script as wrapper around the "standard"
(platform independent) test executable. Wrappers can also be defined by using
the LOG_COMPILER variable of automake.
This is applicable in cases where the same wrapper should be used for more then
one test, as the test name is passed has parameter to the wrapper. A wrapper is
just a program expecting one argument: the test name.

Automake also supports the usage different wrappers based of the executable
filename suffix. See
https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Parallel-Test-Harness.html[Parallel-Test-Harness]
for more information.

To add a wrapper around the executed test, just add the following LOG_COMPILER
definition line in the '<PLATFORM_SPECIFIC>/Makefile.am':

[source,am]
----
...
if test_vald
LOG_COMPILER = $(top_srcdir)/platform/linux-generic/test/wrapper-script
TESTS = pktio/pktio_run \
...
----

Here follows a dummy example of what wrapper-script could be:

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

# The parameter, $1, is the name of the test executable to run
echo "WRAPPER!!!"
echo "running $1!"

# run the test:
$1
# remember the test result:
res=$?

echo "Do something to clean up the mess here :-)"
# return the test result.
exit $res
----

Note how the above script stores the return code of the test executable to
return it properly to the automake test harness.

==== Defining platform specific tests ====

Sometimes, it may be necessary to call platform specific system calls to check
some functionality: For instance, testing odp_cpumask_* could involve checking
the underlying system CPU mask. On linux, such a test would require using the
CPU_ISSET macro, which is linux specific. Such a test would be written in
'<PLATFORM_SPECIFIC>/cpumask/...' The contents of this directory would be very
similar to the contents of the platform agnostic side cpu_mask tests
(including a Makefile.am...), but platform specific test would be written there.
'<PLATFORM_SPECIFIC>/Makefile.am' would then trigger the building of the
platform specific tests (by listing their module name in SUBDIRS and therefore
calling the appropriate Makefile.am) and then it would call both the platform
agnostic executable(s) and the platform specific test executable.

==== Marking tests as inactive ====

The general policy is that a full run of the validation suite (a "make check")
must pass at all times. However a particular platform may have one or more test
cases that are known to be unimplemented either during development or
permanently, so to avoid these test cases being reported as failures it's useful
to be able to skip them. This can be achieved by creating a new test executable
(still on the platform side), giving the platform specific initialization code
the opportunity to modify the registered tests in order to mark unwanted tests
as inactive while leaving the remaining tests active. It's important that the
unwanted tests are still registered with the test framework to allow the fact
that they're not being tested to be recorded.

The odp_cunit_update() function is intended for this purpose, it is used to
modify the properties of previously registered tests, for example to mark them
as inactive. Inactive tests are registered with the test framework but aren't
executed and will be recorded as inactive in test reports.

In 'test/validation/foo/foo.c', define all tests for the 'foo' module:

[source,c]
------------------
odp_testinfo_t foo_tests[] = {
	ODP_TEST_INFO(foo_test_a),
	ODP_TEST_INFO(foo_test_b),
	ODP_TEST_INFO_NULL
};

odp_suiteinfo_t foo_suites[] = {
	{"Foo", foo_suite_init, foo_suite_term, foo_tests},
	ODP_SUITE_INFO_NULL
};
------------------

In 'platform/<platform>/test/foo/foo_main.c', register all the tests defined in
the 'foo' module, then mark a single specific test case as inactive:

[source,c]
------------------
static odp_testinfo_t foo_tests_updates[] = {
	ODP_TEST_INFO_INACTIVE(foo_test_b),
	ODP_TEST_INFO_NULL
};

static odp_suiteinfo_t foo_suites_updates[] = {
	{"Foo", foo_suite_init, foo_suite_term, foo_tests_updates},
	ODP_SUITE_INFO_NULL
};

int foo_main(void)
{
	int ret = odp_cunit_register(foo_suites);

	if (ret == 0)
		ret = odp_cunit_update(foo_suites_updates);

	if (ret == 0)
		ret = odp_cunit_run();

	return ret;
}
------------------

So 'foo_test_a' will be executed and 'foo_test_b' is inactive.

It's expected that early in the development cycle of a new implementation the
inactive list will be quite long, but it should shrink over time as more parts
of the API are implemented.

==== conditionnal tests ====

Some tests may require specific conditions to make sense: for instance, on
pktio, checking that sending a packet larger than the MTU is rejected only makes
sense if packets can indeed, on that ODP implementation, exceed the MTU.
A test can be marked conditionnal as follows:

[source,c]
------------------
odp_testinfo_t foo_tests[] = {
	...
	ODP_TEST_INFO_CONDITIONAL(foo_test_x, foo_check_x),
	...
	ODP_TEST_INFO_NULL
};

odp_suiteinfo_t foo_suites[] = {
	{"Foo", foo_suite_init, foo_suite_term, foo_tests},
	ODP_SUITE_INFO_NULL
};
------------------

Foo_test_x is the usual test function. Foo_check_x is the test precondition,
i.e. a function returning an bollean (int).
It is called before the test suite is started. If it returns true, the
test (foo_test_x) is run. If the precondition function (foo_check_x above)
returns false, the test is not relevant (or impossible to perform) and it will
be skipped.

=================
*Note*

Conditionnal tests can be marked as inactive, keeping the precondition
function. Both the test and the precondition function will be skipped,
but re-activating the test is then just a matter of changing back the macro
from ODP_TEST_INFO_INACTIVE to ODP_TEST_INFO_CONDITIONAL:

[source,c]
------------------
	...
	/* active conditionnal test */
	ODP_TEST_INFO_CONDITIONAL(foo_test_x, foo_check_x),

	/* inactive conditionnal test */
	ODP_TEST_INFO_INACTIVE(foo_test_y, foo_check_y),
	...
------------------
