/**
 * General Purpose TCP/UDP checksum function
 *
 * This function handles all the different checksum operations like
 * ODPH_CHKSUM_GENERATE, ODPH_CHKSUM_VERIFY and ODPH_CHKSUM_RETURN for both
 * TCP and UDP pkts over either IPv4 or IPv6.
 * Note that the packet will be modified only if op==ODPH_CHKSUM_GENERATE.
 * In the case of ODPH_CHKSUM_RETURN, the checksum will be calculated, but
 * will neither be written or compared, but just returned via the chksum_ptr
 * parameter (assuming that chksum_ptr is non NULL).  Because the code doesn't
 * know whether a GENERATE or VERIFY is occurring, when using
 * ODPH_CHKSUM_RETURN it is important that the chksum field be well defined
 * (either the value as received or set to 0
 * when created).  Note that for ODPH_CHKSUM_GENERATE, the existing chksum
 * field is ignored (i.e. the code will zero it out before computing the
 * chksum).  See also comments in the convenience functions below.
 *
 * @param  odp_pkt     Calculate the chksum for this pkt and based on the op
 *                     parameter either replace the existing chksum field,
 *                     or verify that it is correct or just return it.
 * @param  op          What is to be done with the calculated chksum.
 *                     doesn't handle tunnels of multiple IPv4/IPv6 headers.
 * @param  chksum_ptr  Pointer to a 16 bit field where the checksum will be
 *                     written.  Note that if this pointer is non NULL, the
 *                     calculated checksum will always be returned regardless
 *                     of op.  Note that the calculated chksum always includes
 *                     the chksum in the TCP or UDP header.
 * @return             Returns < 0 upon an error which prevents the checksum
 *                     calculation. Returns 0 when there is no error AND the
 *                     op is either ODPH_CHKSUM_GENERATE or ODPH_CHKSUM_RETURN.
 *                     If there is no error and the op is ODPH_CHKSUM_VERIFY
 *                     then (a) 1 is returned if this is a UDP pkt whose
 *                     incoming checksum value was 0 (indicating a disabled
 *                     UDP chksum), else (b) 0 is returned if the incoming
 *                     chksum is "correct" (i.e. calculated value is 0),
 *                     else (c) 2 is returned if the incoming chksum is
 *                     incorrect (including the case of an incoming TCP chksum
 *                     of 0).
