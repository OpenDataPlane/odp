== OpenDataPlane (1.22.0.0)
=== Summary of Changes
ODP v1.22.0.0 adds several smaller API changes mainly related to API
clarification.

=== API Changes
==== Added `odp_queue_order_t` parameter to `odp_queue_param_t`
Added a parameter to control if a destination queue does not require event
re-ordering. By default, event order is maintained for all destination queues as
before. Application may use `ODP_QUEUE_ORDER_IGNORE` for those queues that are
used under ordered queue context, but do not require re-ordering and/or do need
to avoid extra re-ordering delays.

==== Added `ODP_SHM_HP` flag for `odp_shm_reserve()`
When set, this flag guarantees that the memory reserved by `odp_shm_reserve()`
is allocated from huge pages. If enough huge page memory is not available the
call will fail.

==== Improved initialization and termination specification
Improve specification of initialization and termination steps. Explicitly list
those functions that may be used before global init (those that are needed for
setting up parameters). No changes to functionality.

==== Improved queue context specification
Highlight that queue context default value is NULL. This was defined already in
`odp_queue_param_t` specification.

==== New Crypto Algorithm Support
Support for new crypto algorithms is added by defining symbols for:

* `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_3DES_ECB`
* `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_AES_ECB`
* `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_AES_CFB128`
* `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_AES_XTS`
* `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_AES_EEA2`

Support for new crypto authentication algorithms is added by defining symbols
for:

* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_SHA224_HMAC`
* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_AES_EIA2`

Added enumeration for digest (unkeyed) algorithms. They are added as auth
algorithms with empty key required.

* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_MD5`
* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_SHA1`
* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_SHA224`
* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_SHA256`
* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_SHA384`
* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_SHA512`

==== Crypto specification improvements / fixes
Correct documentation for `ODP_AUTH_ALG_SNOW3G_UIA2` to reference 128-EIA1
instead of 128-EEA1.

Clarify IV data format and point to proper documents for 3GPP algorithms.

==== Timer specification clarification
Timer API intention has always been to allow any event type to be used as
timeout events. Application should use `ODP_EVENT_TIMEOUT` type events
(`odp_timeout_t`) by default, but also other event types may be used. Also,
clarified timer set/reset functionality of `odp_timer_set_abs()` and
`odp_timer_set_rel()` functions.

API functionality not changed, just wording updated.

==== Added timer resolution capability
Typically, timer implementation needs to trade-off between highest resolution
and longest timeout. Add new capability information
(`odp_timer_res_capability_t`) and function to check limits between resolution
and maximum timeout length.

`odp_timer_res_capability()`::
This function fills in capability limits for timer pool resolution and min/max
timeout values, based on either resolution or maximum timeout.

==== Added defines for minute and hour
Defines for a minute and an hour are useful e.g. when setting timers for a bit
longer (background, session lifetime, etc.) timeouts.

* `ODP_TIME_MIN_IN_NS`
* `ODP_TIME_HOUR_IN_NS`

=== Helper Changes
==== Added helper library version
Added helper library version defines, so that application can track helper
version independent of ODP API version:

* `ODPH_VERSION_GENERATION`
* `ODPH_VERSION_MAJOR`
* `ODPH_VERSION_MINOR`

Also, added a function for generating easy printout of the versions number.

`odph_version_str()`::
The version string defines the helper library version the following format:
 `<generation>.<major>.<minor>`

==== Added new thread create and join functions
Defined new versions of thread create and join calls. The new calls explicitly
support thread create and join in multiple steps. Also, per thread
(`odph_thread_param_t`) and common parameters (`odph_thread_common_param_t`)
have been improved.

`odph_thread_create()`::
Create and pin threads (as Linux pthreads or processes)

`odph_thread_join()`::
Wait previously launched threads to exit

Old functions `odph_odpthreads_create()` and `odph_odpthreads_join()`
have been deprecated.

==== Added helper debug defines
Added debug defines/macros into helper API and configure options to
enable/disable helper debugging. These defines may be used both in helper and
application code:

* `ODPH_DEBUG` is 1 when helper debugging is enabled (`--enable-helper-debug`)
* `ODPH_DEBUG_PRINT` is 1 when helper debug printing is enabled (`--enable-helper-debug-print`)
* `ODPH_ASSERT()` generates assertion code when helper debugging is enabled

=== Validation Test Improvements
==== Timer Test Improvements
Enables passing tests on high core count devices.

Test min/max timeouts with the highest resolution and longest timeout
parameters.

==== Scheduler Test Fixes
The group test would fail if `odp_schedule(ODP_SCHED_NO_WAIT)` wouldn't return
any events on the first call.

`scheduler_test_pause_resume()` would get stuck if all events were not
successfully enqueued.

Fixed a number of synchronization problems revealed by a scheduler
implementation doing pre-scheduling. Makes sure scheduling context is always
properly released.

==== Classification Test Fixes
Some of the test array elements may have not been set if the number of supported
scheduling priorities was low.

==== Pktio Test Improvements
Added more debug information on magic number misses.

==== Initialization Test Improvements / Fixes
Added missing local init/term calls to all test cases.

Added test case to set num_worker and num_control parameters.

Added test case to set not used features flags in init parameters.

==== Buffer Test Fixes
Test suite missed to output the return value of `odp_cunit_run()`.

==== Queue Test Improvements
Check that queue context pointer value is NULL by default.

==== IPsec Test Fixes
Check pktio level inline IPsec support before running tests.

==== Crypto Test Improvements
Added support for AES-194-GMAC and AES-256-GMAC algorithms.

Added more AES-CBC and AES-CTR test vectors.

=== Example Changes
==== Added new pipeline example application
The application receives packets from one interface and passes them through 0-N
worker stages before outputting them from a second network interface. The RX,
worker, and TX stages are connected using plain queues and each stage is run on
a separate CPU thread. Optionally, the worker stages calculate CRC-32C over
packet data.

==== Time example fixes
Fix single worker deadlock and run the application as part of `make check`.

==== IPsec example fixes
Fixed a number of issues in IPsec example applications and run them during
`make check`.

==== New command line options
===== l2fwd
* added `-b` option to control maximum packet receive burst size

===== pool_perf
* added `-n` option to allocate multiple event bursts before freeing those
* added `-t` option to select between buffer or packet pool types
* added `-s` option to select data size

===== sched_perf

* added `-w` option to simulate application work
* added `-g` and `-j` options to test scheduling with a number of schedule groups

=== Implementation Improvements
==== Pool Implementation Improvements
Refactor local buffer caching into separate functions and optimize
implementation by caching buffer header pointers instead of indices.

New configuration options have been added for local cache
(`pool:local_cache_size`) and burst sizes (`pool:burst_size`).

Pool implementation has been modified to store buffer headers instead of
indices to reduce type conversion overhead.

==== Timer Implementation Improvements
Added warm up period into POSIX timer pool startup to avoid the first timeout
to slip. Otherwise, timer pthread receives the first signal after about 15ms and
first timeout of the pool slips.

==== DPDK Packet I/O Improvements
The zero-copy DPDK pktio implementation has been cleaned up resulting a small
performance improvement. Linking to DPDK library has also been simplified.

=== Miscellaneous
* ODP project has been moved from Linaro to OpenFastPath Foundation. Project
documentation and domain addresses have been updated to reflect this change.

* Added `--without-pcap` configuration option to explicitly build ODP without
PCAP pktio regardless of if the library is available on the build host.

* Added `--enable-lto` configuration option to build ODP with link time
optimization (`-flto` flag).

* Travis default distribution is updated to Ubuntu Xenial.

* Added `-O3`, `-O0`, and LTO build tests to Travis

* Supported Netmap version has been bumped to v13.0

multiple interfaces

== OpenDataPlane (1.21.0.0)
=== Summary of Changes
ODP v1.21.0.0 adds two new API families as well as several small improvements.

==== APIs
===== Compression Support
A new family of APIs is added that provides for session-oriented support for
packet data compression and decompression. Compression sessions define the
parameters used to control compression operations and their associated
integrity hashes.  Once created, sessions are input parameters to the new
`odp_comp_op()` and `odp_comp_op_enq()` APIs that provide access to
synchronous and asynchronous compression services on packets.

Associated with the completion of asynchronous compression operations, a new
packet subtype, `ODP_EVENT_PACKET_COMP` is defined. This subtype indicates
that the packet includes additional metadata (retrievable via
`odp_comp_result()`) that provides the result of the requested operation.

A number of different compression and associated hash algorithms are defined,
which are communicated with three new capability APIs:

`odp_comp_capability()`::
Provides information about general compression related capabilities
offered by this implementation

`odp_comp_alg_capability()`::
Provides details about the capabilities of individual compression algorithms
supported.

`odp_comp_hash_alg_capability()`::
Provides details about the capabilities of individual hash algorithms
supported for use with compression.

===== Flow Aware Scheduler Support
A new capability for flow aware scheduling is added. As part of this, the
scheduler now supports capabilities and configurability. As a result, the
initialization sequence for applications that make use of the ODP scheduler
has changed slightly. The new API call sequence is:
[source,c]
-----
odp_schedule_capability()
odp_schedule_config_init()
odp_schedule_config()
odp_schedule()
-----
It is a programming error to call `odp_schedule()` (or its variants) without
having first initialized the scheduler with an `odp_schedule_config()` call.
This call may only be issued once per ODP instance as scheduler configuration
is global.

By default the scheduler operates as before. When configured to operate in
flow aware mode, the scheduler will now respect event flow ids (managed by the
new `odp_event_flow_id()` and `odp_event_flow_id_set()` APIs) when making
scheduling decisions. This means that flow identification is a combination of
event flow id and queue id. For example, when operating in flow aware mode the
scheduler may dispatch events from an atomic queue to multiple threads
concurrently, as long as those events have different flow ids. For
applications that process large numbers of lightweight flows that have limited
context needs, this can lead to throughput improvements as well as reduced
implementation memory footprint.

==== DPDK v18.11 Support
The latest LTS release of DPDK (v18.11) is now supported by ODP. Support for
the previous LTS release (v17.11) is retained. Prior versions of DPDK are
no longer supported.

==== Queue Capabilities Moved to Scheduler
As part of the introduction of flow-aware scheduling, capabilities associated
with `SCHED` queues have been moved from the `odp_queue_capabilities_t` struct
returned by `odp_queue_capabilities()` to the new `odp_sched_capabilities_t`
struct returned by `odp_sched_capabilities()`.

Capabilities moved include `max_ordered_locks`, `max_sched_groups`, and
`sched_prios`. The `max_sched_groups` capability is renamed `max_groups`. In
addition, `max_queues`, `max_queue_size`, and the support capabilities for
lock free and wait free non blocking queues is now part of the scheduler
capabilities.

In support of flow aware scheduling mode, the `max_flows` scheduler capability
is renamed `max_flow_id`. A value of 0 indicates that flow aware mode
scheduling is not available in this ODP implementation.

=== Test/Validation Improvements
==== Travis readability improvement
The "BUILD_ONLY` environment variable has been renamed `CHECK` for improved
output readability.

==== Flow aware scheduler testing
As part of flow aware mode, scheduler validation tests will now test this mode
if `odp_schedule_capability()` indicates that flow-aware mode is supported.

=== Bug Fixes
==== Unnumbered Bugs/Issues

* Latest version of netmap `nm_ring_empty()` implementation has changed.
PktIO netmap support updated to support this as well as previous releases.

* Improved compatibility of PktIO socket support with latest versions
of the clang compiler.

* Add match pattern for missing DPDK PMD drivers for improved compatibility.

== OpenDataPlane (1.20.0.0)
=== Summary of Changes
ODP v1.20.0.0 is a refresh of ODP, incorporating significant configurability
and performance improvements as well as new APIs and API restructures.

==== APIs
===== Symbol `ODP_SHM_NULL` Removed.
An invalid `odp_shm_t` has the value `ODP_SHM_INVALID`, consistent with other
ODP types. The legacy synonym `ODP_SHM_NULL` is now removed for consistency.

===== New 3GPP Crypto Algorithm Support
New support for 3GPP crypto algorithms is added by defining symbols for

* `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_KASUMI_F8`
* `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_SNOW3G_UEA2`
* `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_ZUC_EEA3`

In addition new authentication algorithm symbols are defined for

* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_KASUMI_F9`
* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_SNOW3G_UIA2`
* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_ZUC_EIA3`

These values are returned as ODP capabilities as well as being accepted in
crypto session creation for implementations that indicate support for them.

===== Crypto Capability for Bitwise Operation
The new `bit_mode` capability Boolean is added to the
`odp_crypto_cipher_capability_t` struct to indicate that an implementation
supports operating in bit mode. When operating in bit
mode, field offsets and lengths are expressed in terms of bits rather than
bytes. However, such lengths must always be specified in multiples of 8.

===== Improved Crypto Spec Documentation
The ODP crypto API specification is tightened to specify default values for
cipher and authentication algorithms. Also documented when key and IV
parameters need to be set.

===== IPsec Extensions
IPsec requires "salt" (extra keying material) when the GMAC authentication
algorithm is used. To accommodate this the `auth_key_extra` field is added to
the `odp_ipsec_crypto_param_t` struct and documentation is added clarifying
when this field is needed and how it should be used.

===== Classifier Type Rename
The `odp_pmr_t` type name for an invalid value is renamed from `ODP_PMR_INVAL`
to `ODP_PMR_INVALID` for consistency with the rest of ODP type names. The old
symbol is still available when ODP is configured with
`--enable-deprecated`.

===== New API for Packet Event Subtypes
The `odp_packet_subtype()` API is added that returns the subtype of a packet
event directly.

===== Streamlined Packet Parsing Results
The `odp_packet_parse_result()` API is added that returns the result of
packet parsing as a single `odp_packet_parse_result_t` struct. This can
offer efficiency improvements for applications that need all parse results
rather than making individual parse result calls.

===== PktIO Extensions to Support per-Queue Configuration
PktIO interfaces support multiple input queues to enable increased parallelism
in I/O processing. Previously, all of these input queues were required to
belong to the same scheduler group. The `odp_pktin_queue_param_t` struct is
now extended with an optional `odp_pktin_queue_param_ovr_t` struct that
permits individual pktin queues to be assigned to separate scheduler groups.
This may permit improved performance for advanced application use cases.

===== Timer Pool Capabilities
The `odp_timer_capability_t` struct is extended to return three additional
pieces of information:

`max_pools_combined`::
The total number of timer pools that can be created combining different
clock sources

`max_pools`::
The maximum number of timer pools for a given clock source.

`max_timers`::
The maximum number of timers in a single pool. A zero value means number is
limited only by available memory.

===== Add Scheduler mix/max/default Priority Functions
Three new APIs: `odp_schedule_max_prio()`, `odp_schedule_min_prio()`, and
`odp_schedule_default_prio()` are added that return the min, max, and default
values specified for the `prio` field in the `odp_schedule_param_t` struct.

With the introduction of these scheduling priority functions the previously
defined macros (`ODP_SCHED_PRIO_HIGHEST`, `ODP_SCHED_PRIO_NORMAL`, and
`ODP_SCHED_PRIO_LOWEST`) are now deprecated and should no longer be used.

===== Specification of `odp_schedule_prio_t` as an `int`
Previously, the `odp_schedule_prio_t` type definition was left to each
implementation. With the addition of explicit schedule priority ranges, this
type is now specified to be an `int` to permit efficient implementation
(including inlining) of these functions.

====== New Scheduler APIs
The new scheduler APIs `odp_schedule_multi_wait()` and
`odp_schedule_multi_no_wait()` are added to provide more efficiently
implementable versions of these functions. The existing scheduler APIs remain
unchanged. These new APIs can simply provide a fastpath for some
applications/implementations as an alternative to specifying a parameter on
`odp_schedule_multi()`.

===== Memory Model in `odp_init_global()`
The `odp_init_t` parameter passed to `odp_init_global()` is extended to
add the `mem_model` field. This field is defined by the new `odp_mem_model_t`
struct and is used to specify whether the application will be using a
thread (`ODP_MEM_MODEL_THREAD`) or process (`ODP_MEM_MODEL_PROCESS`)
memory model. The default is a thread model is used for compatibility with
previous levels of ODP.

==== ABI Changes
A number of changes to the ODP ABI have also been made in this release to
improve application binary portability.

===== Strong Typing for Timer Pools
The `odp_timer_pool_t` is now strongly typed.

===== Consistent Initialization
The values of the various `ODP_xxx_INVALID` symbols for ODP abstract types in
the `odp-linux` reference implementation are now consistently zeros. This
reduces errors and improves portability.

=== Implementation Improvements
==== Configuration File
A new configuration file mechanism is introduced that makes use of
https://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/libconfig_manual.html[libconfig] to
enable various runtime ODP parameters to be specified dynamically.

Default configuration values for the `odp-linux` reference implementation are
contained in the `config/odp-linux-generic.conf` file. Users may override
these default values by supplying their own configuration file. At
`odp_init_global()` time, if the `ODP_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable is set,
this is used to locate the path to the override configuration file.

==== Process Mode Support
The `odp-linux` reference implementation now supports applications that run in
process mode (`mem_model` = `ODP_MEM_MODEL_PROCESS`) as well as the default
thread mode. This support only applies within a single ODP instance, so any
`fork()` calls must be done only _after_ `odp_init_global()` has been called
to initialize ODP on a root process.

==== Removal of `iQuery` Scheduler
The `iQuery` scheduler is removed from the `odp-linux` reference
implementation, as it offers no performance advantages and has not seen
application use.

==== Number of CPUs
The `odp-linux` reference implementation now supports up to 256 CPUs by
default (increased from 128).

==== Support for Large Burst Sizes
The `odp-linux` reference implementation now supports large burst sizes for
both I/O and non-I/O scheduled events. Large bursts (when available) are
received directly to the application without any stashing for improved
throughput. Burst sizes are configurable via the new configuration file
mechanism, as described above.

==== `--without-openssl` Warnings
When building `odp-linux` using `--without-openssl` a warning will be issued
cautioning that strong cryptography will not be available.

==== Inline Queue Enq/Deq APIs
The various enq/deq APIs are now subject to inlining when `odp-linux` is
built with `--disable-abi-compat`.

==== Configurable Timer Controls
Inline timers are now controlled via a config file option. Timer polling
frequency is similarly controlled via the config file.

==== Huge Page Configuration
The config file is now used to specify the huge page usage limit.

==== Single and Multi-Consumer/Producer Rings
The queue implementation in `odp-linux` now automatically makes use of
optimized single and multi-consumer/producer rings to significantly speed
up enq/deq processing.

==== `odp_shm_print_all()` Improvements
The output from `odp_shm_print_all()` is reworked to provide more useful
and comprehensive shared memory usage information in `odp-linux`.

==== IPsec Improvements
SA lifetime checking is now more scalable to multiple threads. This
significantly reduces overhead for multithreaded IPsec applications.

==== Native Builds
When running in non-ABI compatibility mode, `odp-linux` now enables
native machine-specific optimizations for the CPU architecture of the
local machine.

=== Validation Test Improvements
==== SCTP Test Packets
SCTP test packets are now used in parser testing. SCTP headers are added to
ODP and ODP helpers and SCTP checksums are now inserted and verified as part
of validation testing.

==== `odp_packet_reset()` Test
The packet validation test suite now properly tests `odp_packet_reset()`.

=== Helper Changes
In support of process mode, ODP helper functions have been changed to
better match these new capabilities

==== New `enum`
The `odph_linux_thread_type_t enum` has been replaced with the new
`odp_mem_model_t` type.

==== Helper Options
The new `odph_options()` getter function is added that returns
applicable options in effect via the new `odph_helper_options_t` struct.
This currently includes the memory model (thread or process) that is in use.

==== SCTP Helpers
The new helper APIs `odph_sctp_chksum_set()` and `odph_sctp_chksum_verify()`
are added to facilitate working with SCTP packet checksums.

=== Performance Test Improvements
==== Pool Performance
A new `odp_pool_perf` test has been added that stress-tests ODP pool
functions in a multithreaded environment to generate performance statistics.

==== Scheduler Performance
A new `odp_sched_perf` test has been added that stress-tests the scheduler
in a multithreaded environment.

==== CPU Performance
A new `odp_cpu_bench` performance test has been added that runs
compute-intensive packet operations in a multithreaded environment and prints
the observed maximum throughput for each thread.

=== Example Improvements
==== Classifier Example changes
The `odp_classifier` example program now uses a reduced number of threads by
default to reduce elapsed run time. `ODP_THREAD_COUNT_MAX` is also now used as
the max worker count.

==== Generator Improvements
The `odp_generator` example has numerous cleanups and performance improvements.

==== IPsec Example
The `odp_ipsec` example now properly stops and closes pktio devices on exit.

==== Packet Dumping
A new `odp_packet_dump` example is added that prints received packets to the
terminal. This is useful for debugging packet I/O interfaces.

==== Sysinfo Example
A new `odp_sysinfo` example is provided that prints system information. Useful
for checking the ODP environment during debugging. This includes providing
detailed information about the various crypto facilities supported, as well
as the feature flags used at build time (_e.g.,_ if the binary was built with
ARMv8.0 or ARMv8.1 instructions).

==== Traffic Manager Example
The traffic manager example now properly destroys all TM queues it creates
for improved reliability. It also now always prints a proper termination
summary message.

== OpenDataPlane (1.19.0.2)
=== Summary of Changes
ODP v1.19.0.2 is the second service update for the Tiger Moth release. It
incorporates a number of corrections and enhancements that further improve the
quality and testability of ODP.

==== APIs
There are no API changes in this release.

==== DPDK Service Release Sync
ODP is now paired with DPDK 17.11.3 for its DPDK-related support. This is the
current service level for the DPDK 17.11 LTS package used by ODP Tiger Moth.

=== Implementation Improvements
This release incorporates several improvements in the `odp-linux` reference
implementation of ODP.

==== Enhanced Inlining
ODP supports inlining of functions in embedded environments when ABI
compatibility is not needed. ODP itself now makes use of inlined functions for
all relevant internal use of its APIs, leading to improved performance.

==== Completion of CRC API Implementation
The `odp_hash_crc_gen64()` API is now properly implemented and appropriate
validation tests added to support it.

In addition, a streamlined table-based implementation of the basic CRC
functions eliminates the previous dependency on `zlib`.

==== PktIO-Specific Parsing
To better integrate with DPDK parsing capabilities, ODP packet parsing has
been restructured to operate at the PktIO level. This permits DPDK PktIO types
to exploit the native DPDK packet parser and checksum facilities, leading
to better integration.

==== PktIO Internal Cleanup and Restructure
The PktIO functions have been streamlined and refactored in a number of ways
to provide better long-term maintainability of these functions. This includes
moving per-PktIO data into individual files rather than sharing a common file,
as well as better placement for I/O statistics.

==== Checksum Validation Support
Loop PktIO interfaces now add the capability to validate packet L3 and L4
checksums as part of receive processing. The existing `odp_pktio_capability()`
API now reports that checksum validation is available for these interfaces.

==== Single Producer / Single Consumer Queue Performance Optimizations
When defining lock free queues that have only a single producer and consumer,
a streamlined implementation offers significant speedup.

==== Fast PCAPng Packet Capture
Fast pcap capture is now provided in `odp-linux` to capture packets on any
interface. This is enabled via the `--enable-pcapng-support` configuration
option. Once enabled, packets can be captured using a sequence such as:
-----
sudo mkdir /var/run/odp/
start ODP application that reads/writes to the interface of interest
start the ODP application
sudo dd if=/var/run/odp/<pid>-<ifname>-flow-<queue#> of=~/test.pcap

cntrl^c to end capture
wireshark ~/test.pcap to view capture
-----

Interfaces of interest are identified by a string consisting of the
application process ID, the interface name, and the queue number of interest,
if the interface supports multiple queues.

==== Removal of GPL M4 Macros
A number of autotools/autoconf M4 macros used in configuring `odp-linux` have
been rewritten to avoid potential GPL licensing concerns. These macros are
used only during ODP configuration processing and have no role in ODP
or ODP application use.

=== Validation Test Improvements
==== Queue Pair Validation Tests
The validation test suite for queue API testing is enhanced to now test
operation on queue pairs properly. This enables the various enqueue/dequeue
modes defined by the ODP specification to be more fully exercised, leading
to improved API conformance.

==== Scheduling Test Improvements
The scheduling validation tests now better use the various capability APIs to
ensure that implementations are only tested for advertised capabilities.

=== Crypto Test Improvements
The crypto validation tests now better use the various capability APIs to
ensure that implementations are tested across advertised crypto capabilities.

=== Performance Test Improvements
==== New Performance Test
A new `odp_queue_perf` test has been added to test plain (non-scheduled)
queue performance in various modes.

=== Helper Changes
* The `getopt` library calls are no longer used to avoid packaging conflicts
that can arise with this use. There are no changes to helper functionality.
This change simply improves packaging.

=== Examples Improvements
* The `odp_generator` example adds UDP port range support.

==== CI Improvements
Numerous changes to Travis integration are added to improve the quality and
reliability of Continuous Integration (CI) testing.

==== Running ODP on Systems with more than 64 Cores
There are several issues that seem to arise when running ODP applications on
platforms with more than 64 cores. While the most critical of these, which
affected the scheduler, have been fixed in this release, there are others
that are still under investigation. These will be addressed in the next
release of ODP.

== OpenDataPlane (1.19.0.1)
=== Summary of Changes
ODP v1.19.0.1 is the first service update for the Tiger Moth release. It
incorporates a number of corrections and enhancements that improve the quality
and testability of ODP.

==== APIs
There are no API changes in this release.

==== DPDK Service Release Sync
ODP is now paired with DPDK 17.11.2 for it's DPDK-related support. This is the
current service level for the DPDK 17.11 LTS package used by ODP Tiger Moth
and incorporates a number of important bug fixes.

=== Implementation Improvements
The ODP reference implementation has been improved in a number of areas.

==== GCC 8 Support
The GCC 8 series of compilers provides additional warnings about possible
string truncation. A few ODP modules were changed to avoid misleading
warnings when compiling with this level of GCC.

==== Linking with `libnuma`
The `libnuma` library is used for DPDK pktios to provide proper memory
allocation on NUMA-aware systems. Linking with this library is improved to
avoid extraneous error messages at build time.

==== Packet metadata reorganization
Packet metadata is reorganized to reduce the cache footprint used by the ODP
reference implementation, resulting in performance improvements.

==== Random split from crypto module
The `odp_random_xxx()` family of APIs was moved to a separate module
(`odp_random.c`) for modularity and better isolation from planned crypto
enhancements.

==== Shmem improvements
Unnecessary locking is removed from the `odp_fdserver` module, streamlining
operations on shared memory.

==== Timer pools
The default number of timer pools supported by the ODP reference
implementation has been reduced from 255 to 32. This lower number remains
generously adequate for most applications and meaningfully reduces memory
footprint, giving better performance.

==== Timer resolution
During initialization ODP normally measures timer resolution to set the
reported `highest_res_ns`. When such measurement is not able to be performed,
this is not limited to 500ns to avoid bounds errors with overly precise
resolutions.

=== Validation Improvements
The ODP validation test suite has been improved in a number of areas.

==== Crypto validation test
The validation test now correctly handles corner cases when the implementation
under test fails to process any test packets. It also includes the
previously missing `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_AES_CTR` name.

Additionally, since individual implementations indicate which crypto/hash
algorithms are supported via the `odp_crypto_capability()` API, the crypto
validation test now properly uses this information and only tests those
algorithms that the implementation reports as supported. The list of
unsupported algorithms is also reported as part of the test results.

==== `odp_sched_pktio` test improvements
The number of input/output queues used by this test can now be specified,
providing additional controls for test flexibility. In addition, pktout
queues are now selected based on input queue rather than worker id, thus
ensuring packet order flow is maintained.

Finally, an inactivity timer is added that allows the test to report when
packets were handled due to timeout rather than I/O activity.

==== Timer validation test
The validation test for the ODP timer APIs has been reorganized to better
characterize an implementation's conformance to the ODP Timer API
specification.  Since implementations can have widely differing timer accuracy
levels, particularly when running in virtualized environments, the test also
relaxes its bounds checking and enforcement somewhat to better avoid false
negative test results.

Additionally, a timer pool create/destroy test was added as this area was
not adequately covered previously.

=== Documentation Improvements
The `EXTRA_ASCIIDOC_FLAGS` environment variable may now be used to supply
additional build flags for Asciidoctor, which can be used to override
icons and/or fonts for distribution or other needs.

== OpenDataPlane (1.19.0.0)
=== Summary of Changes
ODP v1.19.0.0 is the official Tiger Moth final release. It incorporates final
implementation changes and bug fixes and completes the Tiger Moth ODP
development cycle.

==== APIs
No functional changes for this release. The Tiger Moth API was frozen in ODP
v1.18.0.0.

===== API Documentation Update
The specification for the `odp_packet_l4_chksum_status()` API has been
clarified to reflect that in IPv4 UDP checksums are optional. As a result, a
zero (nonexistent) checksum will be reported as `ODP_PACKET_CHKSUM_OK`.

==== C++ Test Improvements
The {cpp} test included in the ODP validation suite now uses `cout` instead
of `printf()` to ensure that {cpp} is being used to compile it.

==== Queue and Scheduler Configuration
For the ODP Reference Implementation, The `config/odp-linux-generic.conf` file
is extended with sections to control the default and maximum sizes for basic
queues, and the priority spread used by the scheduler for scheduled queues.

The configuration file is a template named `platform/odp-$platform.conf` so
this can be easily inherited by other ODP implementations.

==== Runtime Default `config` File Read Order Improvements
For the ODP Reference Implementation, the default values of the
application-provided `config` file (if used) override the values provided by
the built-in `config/odp-linux-generic.conf` file.

=== Implementation Improvements
The `odp-linux` reference implementation is improved in a number of areas:

==== Netmap Ring Configuration for VALE
PktIO netmap support now uses the ODP config file to allow rings used for VALE
processing to be specified. The supplied defaults provide optimal performance
in typical settings.

==== AES-XCBC-MAC and SHA384-HMAC
These crypto/authentication algorithms are now implemented.

==== Packet Checksum Validation and Insertion
Proper packet checksum validation and insertion, in conformance with the
relevant ODP APIs, is now provided.

=== Dependency Changes

==== DPDK 17.11 Support
The Tiger Moth LTS release is synchronized with the most recent DPDK LTS
release for DPDK pktio support.

==== Removal of dependency on `xxd` package.
This dependency is removed. The Reference Implementation build tools now use
the standard `od` tool rather than the optional `xxd` package.

=== Performance Tests

==== `odp_sched_pktio`
A new test has been added to test the performance of PktIO operations in
scheduled mode. Scheduled PktIO is inherently more scalable and simpler from
an application standpoint than direct (polled) I/O, but depending on the
efficiency of the scheduler implementation can incur additional levels of
overhead. This test can give insight into a given platform's scheduler
efficiency. For the `odp-linux` reference implementation, this test has shown
scheduled I/O to be within 10% of rates achievable via direct I/O, meaning
that for many applications the simplicity and scalability of the event model
is preferable.

==== `odp_ipsec`
A new test has been added that measures outbound (TX) IPsec performance with
a variety of cipher and authentication algorithms.

=== Example Changes

==== `l2fwd` Example
The `README` file associated with this example has been clarified to explain
that this example is a throughput test and as a result does not preserve
packet order under all conditions.

=== Bug Fixes
==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3611[Bug 3611]
ODP linux-generic fails on AArch64 in non-ABI-compat mode.

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3657[Bug 3657]

== OpenDataPlane (1.18.0.1)
=== Summary of Changes
ODP v1.18.0.1 is a fix level for Tiger Moth Release Candidate 2 (RC 2).
It incorporates fixes and performance / serviceability enhancements but no
API changes.

==== APIs
No changes for this release.

==== Corrected Crypto Functionality
This release corrects a merge issue with crypto functionality that resulted in
incorrect crypto operation for certain cipher suites.

==== Runtime Configuration
Introduces a runtime configuration file that can be used by applications to
set selected ODP configuration parameters dynamically at runtime rather than
at `configure` time. At present this is used to configure parameters needed
by DPDK PMDs when using PktIO interfaces in the DPDK class. The intention is
to expand the use of this file over time to allow more dynamic control
of other aspect of ODP runtime configuration.

For the ODP Reference Implementation, a template configuration file is
provided in `config/odp-linux.conf`. Introduction of this support generates
an additional dependency on the `libconfig` package, which must be present to
build ODP.

==== IPsec Traffic Flow Confidentiality (TFC) Corrections
A few missing implementation features associated with TFC packet generation
have been added in this fix level. This support is now functionally complete in
the ODP Reference Implementation.

==== Debug Print Improvements
The information provided in debug builds of the Reference Implementation is
improved to print the interface name on open, start, stop, and close calls.
The driver name and number of queues are also printed to ease verification of
correct configuration.

==== Default Scheduler Performance Improvements
The performance of the default scheduler in the Reference Implementation is
significantly improved in providing scheduled access to PktIO queues. Scheduled
I/O now operates within 10% of the performance achievable using Direct I/O,
while providing incomparably better scalability in multicore environments.

==== `.so` Numbering Changes
In preparation for the Tiger Moth official release, ODP has adopted a
simplified `.so` naming scheme, which is introduced here. ODP `.so` numbers
are now tied to the ODP release number since ODP does not promise backward
compatibility across release boundaries.

== OpenDataPlane (1.18.0.0)
=== New Features
ODP v1.18.0.0 is Tiger Moth Release Candidate 2 (RC 2). It completes the new
APIs that are part of the Tiger Moth Long Term Support (LTS) release of ODP
as well as various performance refinements and bug fixes. As of RC2 the ODP
API is now frozen for the Tiger Moth development series.

==== APIs
The following new and changed APIs are included in this release:

===== Addition of Shared Memory (SHM) Initialization Parameters
The `odp_init_t` struct used as the argument to the `odp_init_global()` API
has been expanded to include a `max_memory` field that specifies the maximum
amount of shared memory (shm) that the application will use. This is to
better enable ODP implementations to optimize their use of shared memory in
support of the application. If left as (or defaulted) to 0, the implementation
may choose a default limit for the application.

===== Crypto Changes
A number of crypto refinements are included in this release:

* The single initialization vector (`iv`) in the `odp_crypto_session_param_t`
is replaced by a separate `cipher_iv` and `auth_iv` fields.

* The single initialization vector (`override_iv_ptr`) in the
`odp_crypto_op_param_t` is replaced by a separate `cipher_iv_ptr` and
`auth_iv_ptr` fields.

* The special nature of GCM and GMAC authenticated encryption modes is
clarified in that these ciphers always combine ciphering with authentication
and hence require both to be specified when used. This is simply a
documentation change as this requirement has always existed.

* Enumerations for AES_CCM (`ODP_CIPHER_ALG_AES_CCM` and
`ODP_AUTH_ALG_AES_CCM`) authenticated encryption modes are added.

* Enumeration for the AES_CMAC authenticated encryption mode
(`ODP_AUTH_ALG_AES_CMAC`) is added.

* Enumerations for the ChaCha20-Poly1305 (`ODP_CIPHER_ALG_CHACHA20_POLY1305`
and `ODP_AUTH_ALG_CHACHA20_POLY1305`) authenticated encryption modes are
added.

* Enumeration for the SHA-384 authentication algorithm
(`ODP_AUTH_ALG_SHA384_HMAC`) is added.

* Enumeration for the AES-XCBC-MAC authentication algorithm
(`ODP_AUTH_ALG_AES_XCBC_MAC`) is added.

===== Lock-free and block-free queues
The `odp_nonblocking_t` enums introduced in ODP v1.17.0.0 are now returned
as separate `odp_queue_capability()` limits for plain and scheduled queues. The
ODP reference implementations now support `ODP_NONBLOCKING_LF` queues.

===== User pointer initialized to NULL
The specification for `odp_packet_user_ptr()` is clarified that unless
overridden by `odp_packet_user_ptr_set()` the value of NULL will be returned.

===== Removal of `ODP_PKTIN_WAIT` option
The `ODP_PKTIN_WAIT` option on `odp_pktin_recv_tmo()` and
`odp_pktin_recv_mq_tmo()` is removed. Timeout options now consist of
`ODP_PKTIN_NO_WAIT` and a user-supplied timeout value. Since this timeout
value can be specified to be arbitrarily long, there is no need for an
indefinite wait capability as provision of such a capability proved
problematic for some ODP implementations.

===== Addition of packet protocol APIs
The APIs `odp_packet_l2_type()`, `odp_packet_l3_type()`, and
`odp_packet_l4_type()` are added to return the Layer 2, 3, and 4 protocols,
respectively, associated with packets that have been parsed to the
corresponding layer. If the packet was not parsed to the associated layer
these return `ODP_PROTO_Ln_TYPE_NONE`.

===== Packet addressability improvements
The documentation of `odp_packet_data()` is clarified to indicated when this
shortcut may be used safely and a new API, `odp_packet_data_seg_len()`, is
added that returns both the address of the start of packet data as well
as the number of bytes addressable from that pointer.

===== Asynchronous ordered locks
Two new APIs, `odp_schedule_order_lock_start()` and
`odp_schedule_order_lock_wait()` are added to allow for asynchronous
ordered lock acquisition in addition to the existing synchronous
`odp_schedule_order_lock()` API. In some implementations and applications,
there may be a performance advantage to indicating the intent to acquire an
ordered lock to allow the implementation to prepare for this while the
application continues parallel processing and then enter the critical section
protected by the ordered lock at a later time. In this case ordered lock
protection is not guaranteed until the `odp_schedule_order_lock_wait()` call
returns.

===== IPsec API miscellaneous changes and enhancements
IPsec support is further enhanced with the following:

* The `odp_ipsec_ipv4_param_t` and `odp_ipsec_ipv6_param_t` structures
are added to formalize the specification of IPv4 and IPv6 options in the
`odp_ipsec_tunnel_param_t` configuration.

* The `mode` field of the `odp_ipsec_out_t` is renamed to `frag_mode` for
better clarity. In addition the `flag.frag-mode` option bit in the
`odp_ipsec_out_opt_t` struct is defined to hold per-operation options for
the `odp_ipsec_out_param_t` struct.

* The `odp_ipsec_capability_t` struct returned by the `odp_ipsec_capability()`
API is expanded to include the `odp_proto_chksums_t` available on inbound
IPsec traffic. This indicates whether and how inbound packet checksums may
be validated for decrypted IPsec traffic.

===== IPsec Traffic Flow Confidentiality (TFC) support
Traffic Flow Confidentiality (TFC) allows applications to defend against
traffic analysis attacks by inserting dummy packets as well as add pad bytes
to packets traversing IPsec flows.

Dummy packets have an L3 type of `ODP_PROTO_L3_TYPE_NONE` in tunnel mode and
`ODP_PROTO_L4_TYPE_NO_NEXT` in transport mode. Padded packets have additional
data suffixed to them that extends beyond the L3 or L4 packet lengths.

For RX processing, inline dummy packets may or may not be dropped from the
inbound packet stream. For lookaside processing they are always visible. For TX
processing, the `odp_ipsec_out_opt_t` struct specifies the `tfc_pad` bit if
the packet is to be padded or the `tfc_dummy` bit if a dummy packet is to
be inserted. The dummy packet length is specified by the `tfc_pad_len` option.

=== Streamlined ABI Support
ABI support has been reorganized to make it more modular and to omit headers
and related ABI files when configure to disable this support.

=== Reference Implementation Fixes and Improvements
The ODP Reference Implementation corporates a number of improvements that
result in better code organization as well as improved processing efficiency.

==== Pktio null device support
In the LNG Reference Implemenations of ODP, the `odp_pktio_open()` API may now
specify devices of class `null` to indicate the PktIO is treated as a dummy
device. Null devices behave just like Linux `/dev/null` in that they never
receive packets and simply discard any packets sent to them.

Note that not all ODP implementations may support this device class. The
specific device classes supported by each ODP implementation may vary and are
listed in their own documentation.

==== Runtime Scheduler Selection
The ODP Reference Implementation offers both a default and a number of
alternate scheduler implementations. Previously these were selectable only at
`configure` time. They can now be dynamically selected at runtime by the use
of the `ODP_SCHEDULER` environment variable. If this environment variable is
not set, the default (basic) scheduler is used. It can be set to select
alternate schedulers:

* `ODP_SCHEDULER=basic` Explicitly selects the default scheduler
* `ODP_SCHEDULER=sp` Selects the strict priority scheduler
* `ODP_SCHEDULER=iquery` Selects the iQuery scheduler
* `ODP_SCHEDULER=scalable` Selects the scalable scheduler

==== Streamlined Queue Implementation
The ODP Reference Implementation now uses a ring model for implementing
ODP queues. This results in greatly improved efficiency for queue operations.
The default maximum queue depth used is 4096 elements, and this information is
returned via the `odp_queue_capability()` API.

==== Validation Test Simplification
The tests that are part of the validation test suite are reorganized and
simplified by having a single test file for each API rather than separate
CUnit driver files and test files.

=== Test/Example Improvements

==== Crypto Test Improvements
The `crypto` validation test suite now offers better information on which
crypto algorithms were skipped because they are not available. Testing of
full HMAC lengths is now added

==== ODP Generator Improvements
The `odp_generator` example now offers configurable RX burst size, selectable
packet handling (Direct I/O or Scheduled I/O), as well as streamlined packet
processing.

==== `l2fwd` Example Improvements
The `l2fwd` example offers improved efficiency via better cache usage.

== OpenDataPlane (1.17.0.0)
=== New Features
ODP v1.17.0.0 is Tiger Moth Release Candidate 1 (RC 1). It introduces
significant new API support as well as functional refinements that expand
ODP offload support to cover IPsec, as well as other improvements.

==== APIs
The following new and changed APIs are included in this release:

===== Event Extensions
The ODP event model has been expanded to include new types as well as event
subtypes. Subtypes are used to qualify an event by indicating that the event
carries additional metadata relating to specific usage or operations.

New event `ODP_EVENT_IPSEC_STATUS` (to be discussed
below) is added. The initial subtypes defined are: `ODP_EVENT_PACKET_BASIC`,
`ODP_EVENT_PACKET_CRYPTO`, `ODP_EVENT_PACKET_IPSEC`, and
`ODP_EVENT_NO_SUBTYPE`, which are also discussed below.

Associated with this support, new event APIs are added:

* `odp_event_subtype()` extracts the `odp_event_subtype_t` from an
`odp_event_t`.

* `odp_event_types()` returns the `odp_event_type_t` and `odp_event_subtype_t`
of an `odp_event_t` in a single call.

* `odp_event_type_multi()` scans a list of `odp_event_t` objects and returns
the number that share the same indicated `odp_event_type_t`. This allows
multiple events to be processed by groups of the same event type.

* `odp_event_filter_packet()` scans a list of `odp_event_t` objects and
partitions them into a returned array of `odp_packet_t` objects and a remaining
array of non-packet events.

* `odp_event_free_multi()` frees multiple events in a single call.

* `odp_event_free_sp()` frees multiple events originating from the same
pool in a single call. The caller must assure that the input events are from
the same pool.

===== IPsec support
ODP Tiger Moth introduces comprehensive protocol offload support for IPsec,
allowing applications to leverage the IPsec acceleration capabilities of many
SoCs. Support includes APIs for Security Association (SA) creation and
lifecycle management, as well as IPsec packet operations for inbound (RX) and
outbound (TX) processing. Packet operations are further divided into lookaside
and inline support.

====== Lookaside Support
Lookaside processing enables IPsec packets to be decrypted into plain packets
or plain packets to be encrypted into IPsec packets in a single operation under
explicit application control. This is useful for packets that need pre- or
post-processing, or to better fit with existing application design.

Two forms of lookaside processing are provided: the `odp_ipsec_in()` and
`odp_ipsec_out()` APIs provide synchronous decrypt and encrypt support,
respectively. The corresponding `odp_ipsec_in_enq()` and `odp_ipsec_out_enq()`
APIs provide these same services in asynchronous form where operations can be
launched and completed later.

====== Inline Support
In contrast to lookaside support, IPsec inline support permits applications to
fully leverage the offload capabilities found in many SoCs by allowing inbound
IPsec packets to be recognized and decrypted automatically before they are
presented to the application for processing. This is done by configuring a
Security Association (SA) and its associated PktIO to operate in inline mode.

Similarly, following output SA and PktIO configuration, the
`odp_ipsec_out_inline()` API permits a packet to be encrypted into an IPsec
packet and automatically scheduled for TX processing in a single
operation. Such "fire and forget" processing enables applications to leverage
IPsec HW support for such processing in a portable manner.

Applications using IPsec inline support need only "touch" a packet once
compared to three times when using lookaside processing, leading to greater
processing efficiency.

====== IPsec Events
New event types and subtypes are introduced to provide support for IPsec
processing. The `ODP_EVENT_PACKET` type has a new subtype:
`ODP_EVENT_PACKET_IPSEC` that provides extended metadata associated with
IPsec packets that have been processed. The new `ODP_EVENT_IPSEC_STATUS`
event, in turn, is used to report IPsec status events such as completion
notifications associated with `odp_ipsec_sa_disable()` calls.

The `odp_ipsec_result()` API is used to obtain IPsec result metadata from
a packet that has event subtype `ODP_EVENT_PACKET_IPSEC`, while the
`odp_ipsec_status()` API is used to obtain IPsec status metadata from an
`ODP_EVENT_IPSEC_STATUS` event.

===== Parser APIs
Packet parsing has been overhauled with the introduction of two new APIs:

* `odp_packet_parse()`
* `odp_packet_parse_multi()`

These use an `odp_packet_parse_param_t` struct to control the type and depth
of parsing to be performed. These routines are intended to be used to
process packets that have been decapsulated following IPsec decryption or other
tunneling or on IP fragments after they have been reassembled.

Associated with this improved parse support, the `odp_parser_layer_t` struct
is deprecated and replaced with a more general `odp_proto_layer_t` struct that
is used both in PktIO configuration as well as the new parser APIs.

===== Crypto AES-CTR and AES-GMAC Support
The ODP crypto APIs are extended to provide support for AES-CTR cipher and
AES-GMAC authentication modes, reflecting the growing availability of
accelerated support for these.

===== Crypto removal of DES-CBC
DES-CBC is no longer considered secure and support for it is removed in ODP.

===== Crypto move AAD length to sessions
The Additional Authentication Data (AAD) length is now part of the
`odp_crypto_session_t` rather than individual crypto operations. This provides
better compatibility with DPDK, which made a similar API adjustment in it's
17.08 release.

===== Crypto Packet APIs
While the `odp_crypto_operation()` API is retained for compatibility,
new packet-oriented variants are introduced that provide additional
capabilities and flexibility. These APIs are:

* `odp_crypto_op()` Performs synchronous crypto operations on one or more
input packets under the control of an associated `odp_crypto_packet_op_param_t`
struct.

* `odp_crypto_op_enq()` Performs asynchronous crypto operations on or or more
input packets under the control of an associated `odp_crypto_packet_op_param_t`
struct.

While `odp_crypto_operation()` calls result in `ODP_EVENT_CRYPTO_COMPL` events
for compatibility, the new packet-oriented APIs result in `ODP_EVENT_PACKET`
events that carry the new event subtype `ODP_EVENT_PACKET_CRYPTO`. These
packets contain additional metadata associated with the crypto operation.
New APIs added for manipulating this metadata include:

* `odp_crypto_packet_from_event()` converts an `odp_event_t` of type
`ODP_EVENT_PACKET` and subtype `ODP_EVENT_PACKET_CRYPTO` to an `odp_packet_t`.

* `odp_crypto_packet_to_event()` converts an `odp_packet_t` crypto packet
back into an `odp_event_t`.

* `odp_crypto_result()` extracts the `odp_crypto_packet_result_t` struct that
contains the crypto metadata associated with an `odp_packet_t` of event
subtype `ODP_EVENT_PACKET_CRYPTO`. This struct provides a summary bit that
says whether the operation completed successfully as well as
`odp_crypto_op_status_t` fields for the `cipher_status` and `auth_status` if a
problem was detected.

===== Classification Random Early Detection (RED) Support
Random Early Detection (RED) provides a means for input HW to ensure that
traffic is treated fairly under conditions of temporary resource overload due
to excessive inbound traffic. ODP RED support provides the ability to measure
and respond to resource pressure on either pools or queues, and only provides
flexibility in how such conditions are to be processed. They can result in
input packet drops or backpressure being indicated by transmitting pause
frames, depending on the underlying platform capabilities.

The `odp_cls_capability_t` struct returned by the `odp_cls_capability()` API
has been expanded to cover this support.

===== Time difference in nanoseconds
The new `odp_time_diff_ns()` API permits the delta between two `odp_time_t`
values to be computed in a single call.

===== PktIO API Changes
====== PktIO Maximum Frame Lengths
The `odp_pktio_mtu()` API is deprecated and replaced by two new APIs:
`odp_pktin_maxlen()` and `odp_pktout_maxlen()`. These return the maximum
sized packets that are supported for RX and TX processing,
respectively, on a given `odp_pktio_t`.

====== PktIO settable MAC address
The `odp_pktio_mac_addr_set()` API is added to allow setting of the MAC
address associated with an `odp_pktio_t`. The `odp_pktio_set_op_t` field of
the `odp_pktio_capability_t` returned by the `odp_pktio_capability()` API now
includes the `mac_addr`` field to indicate that this `odp_ptkio_t` supports
setting its MAC address.

====== Multiple loop devices
The reserved device name `loop` is now extended to `loopX` where X == integer
(_e.g.,_ `loop1`, `loop2`, etc.). For compatibility, `loop` is a synonym for
`loop0`.

===== Pool API Changes
====== Pool extent info
The `odp_pool_info()` API is extended to return the `min_data_addr` and
`max_data_addr` fields. These provide information about the minimum and maximum
application-visible addresses that may be seen in objects allocated from a
particular `odp_pool_t`. Some applications use this information to enable them
to store buffer addresses in compressed format. For example, if the
"span" of valid addresses is less than 4GB this allows a 64-bit buffer address
to be stored as a 32-bit offset.

Since this is purely informational, ODP implementations are under no constraint
as to what addresses may be returned for these fields. 0 and `UNINTPTR_MAX`
may be used if there are no limits on pool extents.

====== Pool subparameter support
The `odp_pool_param_t` structure has been expanded to provide more flexibility
to support platforms that are able to offer multiple segment sizes within a
single pool. This can lead to greater storage efficiency. These are called
subparameters and implementations supporting up to 7 of these are accommodated
with these extensions.

The `odp_pool_capability_t` structure is expanded to return the number of
subparameters supported by this implementation. The application, in turn,
specifies its expected packet size and number distribution in the
`odp_pool_pkt_subparam_t` structure that is part of the `odp_pool_param_t`
used to define the characteristics of `ODP_POOL_PACKET` pools.

This is fully compatible with previous packet pool support since ODP
implementations are under no obligation to support pool subparameters and
these, when present, are advisory in nature. They simply serve to allow the
application to better communicate its expected packet distribution within a
pool so that the ODP implementation may better optimize storage use in the
pool.

===== Checksum support
Checksum processing support has been formalized with the addition of APIs for
determining packet checksum status, controlling packet checksum processing,
retrieving partially computed checksums on packets, and computing checksum
partial sums for memory areas.

====== Checksum status
The APIs `odp_packet_l3_chksum_status()` and `odp_packet_l4_status()` are
added to allow the results of packet input checksum processing to be
queried. These APIs return an `odp_packet_chksum_status_t` enum that indicates
whether checksum validation processing was performed and if so whether the
layer 3 or 4 checksum was found to be valid. This is applicable to both
normal packet input as well as those processed via IPsec.

====== Checksum insertion
PktIOs output checksum processing is configured as part of the
`odp_pktout_config_opt_t` struct used as input to `odp_pktio_config()` API.
These control whether L3 and/or L4 checksums are to be inserted by default
as part of packet TX processing.

Individual packets may override these defaults via the new
`odp_packet_l3_chksum_insert()` and `odp_packet_l4_chksum_insert()` APIs. These
take precedence over the PktIO default, allowing checksums to be inserted
when the PktIO default is to not insert checksums or to suppress checksum
insertion if when the PktIO default is to insert checksums.

====== One's complement sums
Two new APIs: `odp_packet_ones_comp()` and `odp_chksum_ones_comp16()` are
added to assist in application-managed checksum processing. If an
implementation has computed a partial checksum as part of the receive
processing for an IP fragment, for example, then `odp_packet_ones_comp()` can
be used to retrieve this computed value, as well as the byte range over which
it was computed. The `odp_chksum_ones_comp16()` API, by contrast, allows the
application to perform a 16-bit ones-complement sum over a range of in-memory
bytes. Together these can be used to calculate IPv4, TCP, and UDP checksums.

===== Packet multi-event conversion and single pool support
New packet APIs have been added to streamline packet processing:

* `odp_packet_free_sp()` is the same as `odp_packet_free_multi()` except that
the application guarantees that all packets come from the same pool.

* `odp_packet_from_event_multi()` allows multiple events to be converted
from `odp_event_t` to `odp_packet_t` objects in a single call. The caller
guarantees that all input `odp_event_t` objects are of type `ODP_EVENT_PACKET`.

* `odp_packet_to_event_multi()` converts multiple `odp_packet_t` objects to
corresponding `odp_event_t` objects in a single call.

===== Shared Memory API changes
Several changes have been made to the ODP shared memory APIs:

* The `name` field used as input to `odp_shm_reserve()` is now optional.
If specified as `NULL` the shared memory area is anonymous and cannot be
looked up with `odp_shm_lookup()`. There is also no requirement that names be
unique. Duplicate names result in indeterminate output from `odp_shm_lookup()`.

* The `odp_shm_info_t` now includes the `page_size` of the shared memory block
and it's (optional) name.

* `odp_shm_print()` API is added to print implementation-defined information
associated with the `odp_shm_t` to the ODP log for diagnostic purposes.

===== Add support for non-blocking Queues
New queue attributes are introduced to characterize queue behavior as
blocking or non-blocking. A blocking queue may stall other threads if a thread
is interrupted or suspending during an enqueue or dequeue operation.
Nonblocking queues may be either lock free or wait free and provide
progress and fairness guarantees to all threads regardless of
interruptions or stalls on the part of threads performing queue operations.

The various `odp_nonblocking_t` attributes available are returned by the
`odp_queue_capability()` API for both plain and scheduled queues and are in
turn requested as part of the `odp_queue_param_t` struct passed to the
`odp_queue_create()` API. The intent is to allow applications that have
realtime response requirements to better express these needs and utilize
platform-specific capabilities in this area.

===== Scheduler ordered lock API changes
The following changes have been made to the scheduler APIs:

* Documentation clarifies that an ordered context may only hold one ordered
lock at a time. Results are undefined if a second ordered lock is attempted to
be acquired while already holding one.

* The `odp_schedule_order_unlock_lock()` API is added to permit an ordered
context to switch from one ordered lock to another in a single operation.

===== Timer Capabilities
The `odp_timer_capability()` API is added to return an `odp_timer_capability_t`
struct that details platform-specific timer capabilities for application use.
The only capability currently defined is `highest_res_ns`, which indicates the
highest supported resolution supported by a timer. This is the minimum valid
value for the `res_ns` timer pool parameter.

=== Scalable Scheduler
The `odp-linux` reference implementation adds a new _scalable scheduler_ to
the existing default, strict priority, and iquery schedulers. This is enabled
by:

`./configure --enable-schedule-scalable`

The scalable scheduler is designed to offer superior scalability in many core
environments, especially on AArch64 platforms.

=== Miscellaneous Fixes and Improvements
The following miscellaneous improvements have been made to the `linux-generic`
reference implementation of ODP.

==== Additional packet inline functions
When compiling with `--enable-abi-compat=no` the following additional packet
functions are inlined:

* `odp_packet_l2_offset()`
* `odp_packet_l2_ptr()`
* `odp_packet_l3_offset()`
* `odp_packet_l3_ptr()`
* `odp_packet_l4_offset()`
* `odp_packet_l4_ptr()`

==== Dependencies
The ODP test suite now automatically skips C++ tests if no C++ compiler
is available.

The odp_pktio_ordered tests are only performed if PCAP is available.

The DEPENDENCIES file has been updated to reflect build/test requirements for
running under Red Hat Linux distributions.

==== DPDK 17.08 Support
PktIO DPDK support has been upgraded to DPDK 17.08.

=== Test/Example improvements
=== l2fwd Example
A verbose option is added to provide more detail on test runs.

=== ODP generator
Numerous performance improvements have been made that results in significantly
better I/O rates. This includes a configuration option to control checksum
usage.

== OpenDataPlane (1.16.0.0)
=== New Features
ODP v1.16.0.0 is the final preview release before the official release of
Tiger Moth. It introduces new APIs and extensions, as well as bug fixes and
functional improvements.

==== APIs
The following new and changed APIs are included in this release:

===== Initialization Changes
The new `odp_feature_t` type is introduced that defines various feature bits
for ODP components. This is used in an expanded `odp_init_t` argument to
`odp_init_global()` to specify which ODP features are unused by the
application. For example, if the application knows it will not be making use
of crypto features or the classifier, this may permit the ODP implementation
to configure itself more efficiently. Results are undefined if an application
asserts that it will not be using a feature and it attempts to do so
afterwards.

Associated with this new support the `odp_init_param_init()` API is added
to initialize the `odp_init_t` struct to default values.

===== Packet API Changes

* The `odp_packet_unshared_len()` API is removed. Testing showed that this
API was non-essential and conflicted with the goal of implementation
efficiency.
* The `odp_print_packet_data()` API is added. This permits packet data to
be logged along with platform-defined metadata for debugging or diagnostic
purposes.

===== PktIO API Changes

* The `loop_supported` attribute of the `odp_pktio_capability_t` struct is
deprecated since this is redundant. The `enable_loop` field of the
`odp_pktio_config_t` struct (which is returned as part of the
`odp_packet_capability_t` struct) is the proper way to determine whether a
PktIO supports loopback mode.

===== System Info API Changes

* The documentation for the `odp_sys_huge_page_size()` API is updated to
clarify that a 0 return code indicates that huge pages are not supported by
this platform.
* The `odp_sys_huge_page_size_all()` API is added to return all
huge page sizes supported by this platform.

===== Timer API Changes

* The documentation for the various parameters contained in the
`odp_timer_pool_param_t` struct are expanded and clarified.

=== Miscellaneous Fixes and Improvements

==== Default Packet Headroom
The default packet headroom in `odp-linux` has been increased from 66 to
128 bytes for better compatibility with `odp-dpdk`.

==== Zero-copy Packet References
The `odp-linux` reference implementation now fully supports zero-copy
packet references. Previously these APIs were implemented via packet copies,
which while functionally correct, were not how these APIs are intended to
operate.

==== DPDK Zero-copy I/O support
The `--enable-dpdk-zero-copy` `configure` option is added to allow DPDK PktIO
devices to avoid data copies, leading to improved performance.

==== DPDK Checksum offload support
DPDK PktIO now makes use of RX and TX IP/UDP/TCP checksum offload.

==== Shared memory stored in /dev/shm
In the `odp-linux` reference implementation, shared memory is now backed to
`/dev/shm` rather than `/tmp` for better reliability and robustness. This may
be overridden as part of ODP build-time customization if desired.

==== IPC Improvements
PktIO IPC support has received improvements in both performance and
reliability and is now suitable for development use.

==== Netmap Improvements
The thread ID is now used to create unique vdev MAC addresses to avoid
conflicts with multiple ODP processes running on the same host system.

==== `drv` directory removed
The `include/odp/drv` directory and related files have been removed. Driver
support is moved to a follow-on ODP release, so removing these files avoids
confusion as they are still incomplete.

=== Dependency Changes

==== Dependency on autoconf-archive removed
Since some build environments do not supply autoconf-archive, this dependency
is removed.

==== DPDK support upgraded to 17.08 release
The ODP DPDK Packet I/O support has been upgraded to work with the DPDK 17.08
release.

==== Added support for OpenSSL 1.1.x releases
ODP use of OpenSSL for crypto processing has been upgraded to allow use of
OpenSSL 1.1.x.

=== Build System Restructure
The ODP build system has been overhauled to support more comprehensive and
efficient automated testing under Travis CI. Greater use of Autoconf is now
made to control ODP configuration and build options, permitting greater
environmental flexibility. This includes an expanded range of test coverage,
including cross-compilation support for ARMv8, MIPS,and Power architectures,
as well as testing under the latest levels of GCC and clang.

=== Arm Architecture Support Improvements

* ARMv8 generic timer support is now included
* Improved time efficiency and accuracy by using native ARMv8 time/clock
instructions.

==== Test Improvements
The `test` directory has been reorganized and streamlined. Platform-specific
tests are moved from `test/linux-generic` to
`platform/linux-generic/test/`.  As a result, the `test/common_plat`
directory is deleted so that `test/validation`, `test/performance`, etc. are
now used for all platform-independent tests.

==== Examples Improvements

===== IPv4 Fragmentation Reassembly Example
The `ipfragreass` example program has been added to demonstrate IPv4 fragment
reassembly.

===== ODP Generator Improvements
The `odp_generator` example program now uses packet references for improved
performance in UDP and ICMP traffic. The program also now makes use of HW
checksum offload support, when available.

=== Documentation Improvements

* The ODP Users Guide has clarified usage information about the ODP time
APIs for better portability.
* A section has been added to the ODP Users Guide on API specification
principles. This clarifies expected behavior of ODP applications and
implementations and makes explicit what the specification means by "undefined
behavior".
* All Doxygen used in ODP is upgraded to conform to the stricter documentation
requirements introduced by Doxygen 1.8.13.

== OpenDataPlane (1.15.0.0)
=== New Features
ODP v1.15.0.0 continues the preview of Tiger Moth, introducing new APIs and
extensions, as well as numerous bug fixes and functional improvements.

==== Deprecation Framework
To permit smoother evolution of the ODP API specification, a deprecation
framework is introduced to permit controlled deprecation.

When an ODP API or defined struct parameter is deprecated, ODP validation
tests will be updated to no longer use that API and instead use the
replacement API. By default, attempts to compile with the older API/feature
will fail and applications wishing to move to the new ODP release should be
updated to use the replacement API. To permit evaluation of new ODP
releases in advance of such updating, however, ODP supports the `configure`
option `--enable-deprecated`, which makes the obsolete APIs visible again.

This feature will be used on a case-by-case basis and documented in the
release notes for each release that introduces replacement API(s). In general
the deprecated forms will not be maintained for more than a single release
cycle. After that they will no longer be present in the API specification and
the replacement forms must be used to compile with that level of the API
specification.

==== APIs
A number of new and refined APIs are introduced in crypto, packet parsing,
and queue configuration:

===== Crypto Enhancements
The ODP crypto APIs receive several enhancements in this release:

====== New Authentication Algorithms
Additional enumerations added for HMAC-SHA-1 and HMAC-SHA-512 authentication.

====== Deprecated Cipher/Authentication Algorithms
The following cipher/authentication algorithms have been deprecated in favor
of newer replacement algorithms:

* `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_AES128_CBC` is replaced by `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_AES_CBC`
* `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_AES128_GCM` is replaced by `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_AES_GCM`
* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_MD5_96` is replaced by `ODP_AUTH_ALG_MD5_HMAC`
* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_SHA256_128` is replaced by `ODP_AUTH_ALG_SHA256_HMAC`
* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_AES128_GCM1 is replaced by `ODP_AUTH_ALG_AES_GCM`

====== Deprecated Name for Crypto Parameter struct
`odp_crypto_op_params_t` is deprecated in favor of `odp_crypto_op_param_t`
for consistency with other ODP `param` structs.

====== Digest Length Session Parameter
`odp_crypto_session_param_t` adds the field `auth_digest_len` to permit
specification of the authentication digest length to be used for this
session. The `odp_crypto_auth_capability()` API returns the list of
supported digest lengths.

====== Additional Authentication Data (AAD)
The `odp_crypto_op_param_t` struct adds an optional pointer and length for
AAD information. This allows applications to specify AAD information from
the list of supported lengths provided by `odp_crypto_auth_capability()`.

===== Packet Range Data
The former `odp_crypto_data_range_t` type is deprecated and renamed to
`odp_packet_data_range_t` since it can be used to specify ranges for other
than crypto purposes.

===== Parser Configuration
Applications may now specify the maximum packet layer of interest. For
example, a router may not care about anything beyond ISO Layer 3 in packets.
This can be used by ODP implementations to control the depth of packet
parsing needed by the application and may allow greater efficiency,
especially in software implementations.

This is controlled by a new `odp_pktio_parser_layer_t` enum that is
part of the new `odp_pktio_parser_config_t` struct that is added to the
`odp_pktio_config_t` struct used by the `odp_pktio_config()` API. The
supported parser layers are also returned in this struct as part of the
`odp_pktio_capability_t` struct returned by the `odp_pktio_capability()` API.

===== Queue Size Parameter
The `odp_queue_capability_t` struct returned by the `odp_queue_capability()`
API is enhanced as follows:
* The `max_queues` field is now defined to return the maximum number of event
queues of any type.
* New sub-structs (`plain` and `sched`) are added that detail the `max_num` of
queues of that type supported as well as the new field `max_size` that
specifies the maximum number of elements that each queue of this type can
store. A value of zero for `max_num` indicates no fixed limit.

In addition, the `odp_queue_param_t` passed to `odp_queue_create()` now adds
a `size` field to allow applications to specify the minimum number of events
that this queue should be able to store. A value of zero specified requests that
the implementation default limits be used.

The ODP examples have been updated to show this configuration, for example,
the `l2fwd_simple` example does Layer 2 forwarding and hence doesn't need
packets to be parsed beyond Layer 2. So prior to opening an interface via
`odp_pktio_open()` the configuration processing now includes code of the form:
[source,c]
-----
odp_pktio_config_init(&config);
config.parser.layer = ODP_PKTIO_PARSER_LAYER_L2;
odp_pktio_config(pktio, &config);
-----
This serves as a hint to the ODP implementation that parsing beyond Layer 2
is not required on this interface.

===== Removal of `odp_time_to_u64()` API
The `odp_time_to_u64()` API is removed without deprecation in this release.
This is redundant since the `odp_time_to_ns()` API already returns a `uint64_t`
value for `odp_time_t` and can be used for the same purpose.

===== New `odp_sys_info_print()` API
For debugging / diagnostic use, the `odp_sys_info_print()` API is added.
This prints implementation defined information about the system and ODP
environment and may contain information about CPUs, memory, and other
hardware configuration.

=== Helpers
==== Linux Helpers
ODP helper functions fall into two categories: system-independent, and those
that rely on Linux. For backwards compatibility, these have been
reorganized into a new `helper/linux` directory that is installed only when
the `--enable-helper-linux` `configure` option is specified.

=== `odp-linux` Performance
==== Scheduler Improvements
The default scheduler is streamlined by using precomputed weight tables and
separated priority queues for different scheduling groups. This improves
both latency and scalability.

Also included in this change, the default number of scheduling groups is
lowered from 256 to 32, which experience has shown is sufficient for most
applications.

The scheduler fairness checks are also enhanced to avoid low priority event
starvation if `CONFIG_BURST_SIZE` is set to 1.

=== `odp_linux` Crypto Improvements
* Errors in implicit packet copy operations performed during crypto operation
are now handled properly.
* If `odp_crypto_session_create()` fails, proper cleanup is now performed to
avoid memory leaks.
* The auth digest len is now used when calculating HMACs, and full-length
digests are now added to supported SHA capabilities.
* Numerous crypto functions have been rewritten to use the OpenSSL `EVP_`
functions for improved efficiency and accuracy.

=== `odp-linux` Packet Improvements
* The packet parser now recognizes ICMPv6 packets in addition to ICMPv4.

=== `odp-linux` PktIO Improvements
* The `ethtool` and `socket` drivers add additional initializations to avoid
valgrind warnings.
* The `dpdk` driver is upgraded to DPDK 17.02 and is now also built with the
`--whole-archive` option, which means that PMDs no longer need to be linked
individually but are automatically included in builds that make use of DPDK
pktio support.

=== `odp-linux` Time Improvements
* The ODP Time APIs are now more efficiently handled by replacing the previous
Linux timespec with simple nanoseconds (ns) and using native hardware time
counters in x86 and ARM environments, when available.

=== `odp-linux` Traffic Manager Improvements
* Weighting is now handled properly when weight=1 is specified. Previously
this caused an overflow that distorted packet priorities.

=== Miscellaneous Fixes and Improvements
==== Native Clang build on ARMv8
ARMv8 compilation now works properly when using the clang compiler.

==== Test Improvements
* The `odp_scheduling` performance test now handles dequeueing from
potentially concurrent queues properly.
* The traffic manager and time tests are now invoked via scripts to better
account for load-sensitivity when running regressions in CI environments.
* The l2fwd test now supports an additional parameter to specify the number
of scheduling groups to use in the test.
* The `odp_sched_latency` performance test now handles queue draining in
a robust manner.
* The crypto validation tests now properly check and validate message digests,
and include negative tests to verify that incorrect digests are properly
flagged. Note that this may expose omissions in other ODP implementations that
had previously passed this validation test.
* The crypto validation test now adds an explicit test for the NULL cipher,
as well as HMAC-SHA-1 and HMAC-SHA-512.
* The pktio_ipc test now properly cleans up only its own temp files.

==== Examples Improvements
* The `odp_generator` example now properly honors stop criteria based on
number of packets sent.
* The `odp_generator` example now properly flushes output messages
* The `odp_generator` example now supports port configuration.

== OpenDataPlane (1.14.0.0)
=== New Features
==== APIs
ODP v1.14.0.0 represents another preview of the Tiger Moth release series and
introduces new APIs and extensions.

===== Packet References
Packet references are a lightweight mechanism to allow applications to create
and manipulate different "views" of packets. These views consist of shared
bytes common to all references created on the same `odp_packet_t`, possibly
prefixed with unique headers that are private to each reference. Five new APIs
are introduced to enable this feature:

`odp_packet_ref_static()`::
Static references allow a single packet to have multiple "aliases", all of
which must be treated as read only. This is useful, for example, to retain
a reference to a packet being transmitted to support retransmit processing,
since the actual storage represented by a packet is not released until all
references to it have been freed via `odp_packet_free()` calls.

`odp_packet_ref()`::
Dynamic references differ from static references is that they permit the
individual `odp_packet_t` handles to have unique prefixes created via
`odp_packet_push_head()` or `odp_packet_extend_head()` calls. This can be
used, for example, to support multicasting packets to different destinations
by creating packets that consist of unique headers followed by a common shared
payload.

`odp_packet_ref_pkt()`::
Similar to `odp_packet_ref()`, but creates a dynamic reference by prepending a
preexisting header onto another packet.

`odp_packet_has_ref()`::
Returns a boolean indicator of whether a given `odp_packet_t` has other
references that share bytes with this packet.

`odp_packet_unshared_len()`::
Returns the number of unshared bytes accessible through a given `odp_packet_t`
handle. These are the only bytes that should be changed. All other bytes
in the packet should be treated as read only as they are shared with other
`odp_packet_t` handles.

Note that while the packet reference APIs and associated validation tests are
present in this release, the `odp-linux` reference implementation currently
implements references via packet copying. A zero-copy implementation of packet
references is planned to be part of the ODP v1.15.0.0 release.

==== ABI Specification
ODP has supported an Application Binary Interface (ABI) that permits
applications to be generated that are binary portable between select ODP
implementations. This is now formalized with the addition of structures that
permit ABI specifications to be defined that are shared between ODP
implementations. ODP provides a default ABI specification that is the same as
was provided before. This change means that additional ABIs may be defined
that are optimized to collections of platforms that share an Instruction Set
Architecture (ISA) and subscribe to them.

ABI specifications live in the `include/odp/arch/...` directory.

==== Instance Query (iQuery) Scheduler
Adding to the range of scheduler implementations supported by `odp-linux`, a
new scheduler, the instance query scheduler, is available by specifying
`--enable-schedule-iquery` at `configure` time.

This scheduler uses sparse bitmaps and offers scalability advantages when
dealing with large numbers of schedule queues. It otherwise offers performance
comparable to the default ODP scheduler implementation.

=== Helpers
Helpers have been reorganized to provide better independence from odp-linux
and to make them more useful with other ODP implementations. These
reorganizations are functionally transparent to ODP users but should
simplifying packaging and porting to other ODP implementations. This includes
adding the "umbrella" include file `odph_api.h` which can be used to include
all helper API definitions in an application.

=== Classifier Improvements
The `odp-linux` reference implementation now supports Pattern Matching Rules
(PMRs) for IPv6 addresses, inner and outer VLAN IDs, and inner and outer
Ethernet types.

=== Performance

==== Improved inlining for embedded applications
The `odp-linux` reference implementation now offers improved inlining support
for ODP APIs for applications compiled against ODP configured with the
`--enable-abi-compat=no` option, meaning they wish to forego binary
compatibility in exchange for improved performance. These applications remain
source portable to other ODP implementations.

==== Native `odp_cpu_pause()` for ARM processors
A native implementation of the `odp_cpu_pause()` API has been added for ARMv7
and ARMv8 processors.

==== New Microbenchmark
The `odp_packet_bench` microbenchmark application has been added to the
test performance directory to allow implementations to measure and calibrate
the performance of individual ODP packet APIs.

==== Ordered PktIO Test
The `odp_pktio_ordered` application has been added to the test performance
directory to provide stress-testing of packet ordering features of ODP.

=== Documentation
In addition to expanded documentation related to the new packet reference APIs,
a section on applicatin portability has been added that discusses the types
of portability offered by ODP and the tradeoffs that application writers should
consider when using ODP.

=== Bug Fixes

== OpenDataPlane (1.13.0.0)

=== New Features

==== APIs
ODP v1.13.0.0 represents the initial preview of the Tiger Moth release series
and as such introduces new APIs and extensions that will be built on as this
release matures.

===== Crypto Parameter Normalization
Many ODP APIs take parameter structs of type `odp_xxx_param_t`. The crypto APIs,
for historical reasons, failed to follow this convention, using instead structs
of type `odp_crypto_params_t`, etc. These pluralized names are now deprecated
and their singular forms are introduced as the preferred names for these
structs. The old names are retained (for now) to ease migration, however
applications should convert to the new forms at their convenience as these
deprecated forms will be removed in the final Tiger Moth release.

The changes introduced for this include:

* `odp_crypto_op_params_t` => `odp_crypto_op_param_t`
* `odp_crypto_session_params_t` => `odp_crypto_session_param_t`

===== Crypto Decouple Key Length from Algorithm Specification
To provide a more flexible programming for handling all possible
key/digest/iv length combinations, the enums used for crypto specification
are split to decouple lengths from algorithm names. The only exception
is the SHA-2 family of hash routines, which have well-established naming
conventions that incorporate digest lengths (SHA-224, SHA-256, etc.)

Changes included with this restructure include:

* The `odp_crypto_capability_t` structure returned by the
`odp_crypto_capability()` API contains streamlined `odp_crypto_cipher_algos_t`
and `odp_crypto_auth_algos_t` substructures.
* A new `odp_crypto_cipher_capability()` API is added to return detailed
information about available cipher capabilities.
* A new `odp_crypto_auth_capability()` API is added to return detailed
information about available authentication capabilities.

===== `odp_crypto_session_param_init()` API
For completeness the `odp_crypto_session_param_init()` API is provided to
enable platform-independent initialization of the `odp_crypto_session_param_t`
structure used as input to `odp_crypto_session_create()`.

===== Bitfield and Byteorder Cleanup
The `ODP_BITFIELD_ORDER` define is added to the ODP specification to parallel
the existing `ODP_BYTEFIELD_ORDER` define. This will be set to the value
`ODP_BIG_ENDIAN_BITFIELD` or `ODP_LITTLE_ENDIAN_BITFIELD`. This also addresses
https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2402[Bug 2402], however since fixing
this required a small API change this was deferred until an API release
boundary.

===== Improved Name Argument Definitions in `odp_xxx_create()` Functions
The use of name arguments to the various resource creation APIs has
been standardized and documentation improved to clarify that unique
names are not required and that these may be specified as NULL for
anonymous resource creation. When non-unique resource names are used, it is
unspecified which of these are returned by a corresponding lookup API.

===== Pool Parameters for Packet Pools
The `odp_pool_param_t` structure adds the new field `max_len` to be used in
packet pools to advise the implementation of the maximum sized packet that
the application will allocate with a single `odp_packet_alloc()` call. This
may enable storage pool optimization.

===== Packet Clarifications
API documentation for `odp_packet_concat()` and `odp_packet_copy_from_pkt()`
is clarified to specify that the source and destination packets supplied to
these APIs should not refer to the same packet.

===== Packet Allocation Length Clarification
API documentation for `odp_packet_alloc()` is clarified to specify that
the supplied length for requested packet allocation should be greater
than zero.

===== Random API Changes
The APIs provided for working with random data have been revised. The third
parameter to `odp_random_data()` is now of type `odp_random_kind_t`, which is
an `enum` that is used to specify the quality of random data required. The
kinds of random data defined are:

`ODP_RANDOM_BASIC`::
No specific quality guarantees. This is assumed to be pseudo-random data
generated by software where speed of generation is more important than the
quality of the results.This is the lowest kind of random.

`ODP_RANDOM_CRYPTO`::
Random data suitable for use in cryptographic operations.

`ODP_RANDOM_TRUE`::
True random data generated from a hardware entropy source. This is the
highest kind of random.

The `odp_random_max_kind()` API is provided that returns the highest kind of
data available on this implementation. Requests for higher kinds than can be
supplied will fail.

For testing purposes it is often desirable to generate "random" sequences that
are repeatable. To support this use case, the `odp_random_test_data()` API is
introduced. This always returns BASIC random data but uses a user-supplied
64-byte seed parameter that is update for each call and can be used to
repeat the same sequence as needed.

===== Shared Memory Improvements
The `odp_shm_reserve()` API adds two new additional flags to support external
memory.

* `ODP_SHM_SINGLE_VA` guarantees that all ODP threads sharing this memory
will see the block at the same virtual address regardless of whether threads
are implemented as pthreads or processes and when `fork()` calls are made to
create them.

* `ODP_SHM_EXPORT` allows the memory block to be visible to other ODP
instances. Other ODP instances can retrieve this block via the new
`odp_shm_import()` API.

===== Classification Clarifications
The relationship between classification and queue configuration in the
`odp_pktin_queue_param_t` structure is clarified to emphasize that
classification subsumes queue-based I/O processing. This is an API
documentation change only.

=== Helpers
New helper APIs are introduced for IP table lookup support for longest prefix
matching as well as cuckoo hash tables. These are designed to provide analogs
to functions available in DPDK to assist applications being ported to ODP.

=== Performance Improvements
The odp-linux reference implementation includes a number of improvements to
make it more suitable for production use on platforms that rely on software
implementations of key ODP APIs.

==== Ring-based Pool Implementation
Storage pools used for buffers and packets are now implemented via lockless
ring structures that support burst mode read/writes to local caches for
significantly improved multi-core scalability

==== Buffer/Packet Header Optimizations
The layout of the structs used to support buffers and packets has been
optimized to reduce cache footprint and minimize path lengths in packet
manipulation.

==== Ordered Queue Improvements
The implementation of ordered queues has been streamlined and made more
scaleable in multi-core systems.

==== Packet Segmentation Improvements
The more advance segmentation capabilities present in the new ODP packet
implementation are used to streamline the implementation of APIs like
`odp_packet_concat()` and the head/tail extend/trunc APIs.

=== Bug Fixes

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2405[Bug 2405]
A number of "todos" were removed from the packet validation test suite.

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2472[Bug 2472]
The CPU affinity is now correctly read from the cpuset.

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2496[Bug 2496]
The PktIO validation test no longer uses invalid MAC addresses.

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2512[Bug 2512]
The TCP checksum is now properly calculated for generated packets.

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2798[Bug 2798]
The odp-linux reference implementation makes use of the OpenSSL library to
support the `odp_random_xxx()` APIs and some crypto operations. To support
OpenSSL versions prior to 1.1.0, which are not thread safe, support is added
for OpenSSL locking callbacks that use ODP ticketlocks to provide OpenSSL thread
safety.

=== Known Issues

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2812[Bug 2812]
Make check fails on a single core VM in the process mode helper test.

== OpenDataPlane (1.12.0.0)

=== New Features

==== APIs
ODP v1.12.0.0 has no API changes from previous v1.11.0 Monarch LTS. Version
is increased in current development release to make room for Monarch updates
numbers.

==== Application Binary Interface (ABI) Support
Support is added to enable ODP applications to be binary compatible across
different implementations of ODP sharing the same Instruction Set Architecture
(ISA). This support introduces a new `configure` option:

`no abi disable option`::
This is the default and specifies that the ODP library is to be built to
support ABI compatibility mode. In this mode ODP APIs are never inlined. ABI
compatibility ensures maximum application portability in cloud environments.

`--disable-abi-compat`::
Specify this option to enable the inlining of ODP APIs. This may result in
improved performance at the cost of ABI compatibility and is suitable for
applications running in embedded environments.

Note that ODP applications retain source code portability between ODP
implementations regardless of the ABI mode chosen. To move to a different ODP
application running on a different ISA, code need simply be recompiled against
that target ODP implementation.

==== SCTP Parsing Support
The ODP classifier adds support for recognizing Stream Control Transmission
Protocol (SCTP) packets. The APIs for this were previously not implemented.

=== Packaging and Implementation Refinements

==== Remove dependency on Linux headers
ODP no longer has a dependency on Linux headers. This will help make the
odp-linux reference implementation more easily portable to non-Linux
environments.

==== Remove dependency on helpers
The odp-linux implementation has been made independent of the helper library
to avoid circular dependency issues with packaging. Helper functions may use
ODP APIs, however ODP implementations should not use helper functions.

==== Reorganization of `test` directory
The `test` directory has been reorganized to better support a unified approach
to ODP component testing. API tests now live in
`test/common_plat/validation/api` instead of the former
`test/validation`. With this change performance and validation tests, as well
as common and platform-specific tests can all be part of a unified test
hierarchy.

The resulting test tree now looks like:

.New `test` directory hierarchy

-----

==== Pools
The maximum number of pools that may be created in the odp-linux reference
implementation has been raised from 16 to 64.

==== Upgrade to DPDK 16.07
The DPDK pktio support in odp-linux has been upgraded to work with DPDK 16.07.
A number of miscellaneous fixes and performance improvements in this support
are also present.

==== PktIO TAP Interface Classifier Support
Packet I/O interfaces operating in TAP mode now can feed packets to the ODP
classifier the same as other pktio modes can do.

=== Performance Improvements

==== Burst-mode buffer allocation
The scheduler and pktio components have been reworked to use burst-mode
buffer allocation/deallocation, yielding a measurable performance gain in
almost all cases.

==== Burst-mode queue operations
ODP queues internally now attempt to use burst-mode enq/deq operations to
accelerate performance where applicable.

==== Ring-based Scheduler Priority Queues
The ODP scheduler has been enhanced to use ring-based priority queues, resulting
in significantly better scalability in many core environments.

==== GitHub Automation Support
ODP now supports the Travis framework needed to trigger CI automation in
conjunction with GitHub. This support is considered experimental for now.

=== Examples

==== New `l3fwd` Example
A new example application is provided that illustrates use
of ODP for simple Layer 3 forwarding across multiple interfaces.

=== Documentation

==== Pure API Documentation
ODP now generates "pure" (implementation independent) doxygen documentation in
addition to the specific documentation for the odp-linux implementation. The
pure version is applicable to any ODP implementation as it simply describes
the ODP API specification. Implementation-specific versions of this
documentation describe both the APIs as well as specifics concerning typedefs,
enums, etc. This should help clarify what aspects of ODP are platform
independent.

==== Clarify ODP Thread Definition
The definition of an ODP thread in odp-linux has been clarified to specify that
for this implementation ODP threads are Linux pthreads or Linux processes.
Currently threads as processes is considered experimental in odp-linux.

=== Bug Fixes
Numerous refinements have been incorporated to make
validation tests more robust in API coverage as well as correcting corner
cases in the implementation of many ODP APIs. Notable fixes include:

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2316[Bug 2316]
`ODP_TIMEOUT_INVALID` is now defined consistently with other pool elements so
the restriction on using Pool 0 as a timer pool is removed.

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2310[Bug 2310]
The `odp_packet_copy()` API now correctly handles user areas between pools that
are configured with different sized per-packet user area definitions.

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2571[Bug 2571]
Corrects the implementation of AES GCM decryption in the ODP crypto API.

=== Known Issues

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2309[Bug 2309]
The Timer validation test fails sporadically in environments with high core
counts.

== OpenDataPlane (1.11.0.0)
ODP v1.11.0 is the base tag and branch for the Monarch LTS (Long Term Support)
release of ODP.

=== New Features
==== APIs
As part of the final Monarch LTS API set, a minor change to the
`odp_tm_egress_t` struct was made to better reflect the capabilities of
SoC platforms targeting Monarch support. This change adds the boolean
`egress_fcn_supported` that indicates whether TM  systems support an egress
function. In addition, each TM system is now associated with a PktIO rather
than a PktOUT queue. This struct is input to the `odp_tm_create()` API and
output from the `odp_tm_find()` API.

==== Strict Priority (SP) Scheduler
Building on the modular scheduler framework introduced in v1.10.1.0, An
alternate Strict Priority (SP) scheduler is now available. The SP scheduler
is selected when ODP is configured with the `--enable_schedule_sp` option.

The SP scheduler is designed to favor low-latency processing of high priority
work at the expense of throughput. This is considered experimental code at
this point and should be treated as such by those wishing to use it.

=== Bug Fixes
==== Scheduler PktIO Cleanup
The scheduler now properly cleans up PktIOs operating in SCHEDULE mode following
`odp_pktio_close()` calls. This resolves
https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2301[Bug 2301].

==== Chksum Routine C++ conformance
The odph_chksum() helper routine is now C++ conformant. This resolves
https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2302[Bug 2302].

==== User Area Copying
The `odp_packet_copy()` API now copies the packet user area as part of its
processing and the packet validation test has been enhanced to verify that this
is done properly. This resolves
https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2310[Bug 2310].

==== Use of Pool 0 as a Timeout Pool
The internal definition of `ODP_TIMEOUT_INVALID` was changed in `odp-linux` to
enable the use of Pool 0 as a timeout pool. This resolves
https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2316[Bug 2316].

=== Packaging
==== libodphelper
To facilitate API tracking, `libodphelper.so` has been split out from
`libodp.so`.

==== Helper dependencies
To avoid circular dependencies that cause issues when packaging ODP as a
shared library, the `odp-linux` implementation no longer makes and use of
the ODP helper library.

=== Performance
Performance enhancements in the `odp-linux` reference implementation have been
made in PktIO routines and the packet classifier.

=== General Cleanup
General cleanup throughout has resulted in adding proper termination calls to
ODP examples as well as miscellaneous Doxygen corrections.  Additionally, the
`odp-linux` code base has been cleaned up by removing "To Dos" as well as
extraneous `#includes` for extra C headers and dependencies on linux headers
for improved portability.

=== Validation
==== Queue Capability Test
The Queue validation test now properly exercises the `odp_queue_capability()`
API and attempts to create the maximum reported number of supported queues.

==== Platform Tests
The platform-specific tests have been moved from `platform/linux-generic/test`
to `test/platform/linux-generc` so that all tests are now found under a
single `test` directory.

=== Examples
The ODP `examples` directory has been cleaned up and numerous corrections to
existing examples have been made to add proper termination paths, etc. In
addition, a new "hello world" example (`odp_hello.c`) has been added that
illustrates the basic startup and shutdown steps needed for all ODP
applications. As a simple stand-alone application is is also a good initial
build tests for new ODP implementations.

=== Documentation
==== Pure API Guide
The Doxygen API guide has been split so that both a "pure" version that is
platform-independent and retains unresolved ODP abstract types as well as
an implementation-specific version (for `odp-linux`) that shows
platform-specific `typedef` and `enum` values.

==== Implementation Guide Improvements
The _ODP Implementer's Guide_ has been enhanced with a section on
implementation considerations, including issues surrounding the definition of
Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs).

=== Known Issues
==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2309[Bug 2309]
The timer validation tests have seen occasional failures when run on systems
containing a larger number of CPUs (typically 24 or more).

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2386[Bug 2386]
ODP cannot be compiled using the -m32 option to generate 32-bit code on a
64-bit platform when using GCC 4.9 (the default GCC found in Ubuntu 15.04).
This is due to a known bug in GCC 4.9 and is closed as a permanent restriction.

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2402[Bug 2402]
Doxygen generates a warning for `ODP_BIG_ENDIAN_BITFIELD` when compiling on
little endian systems. A similar warning for `ODP_LITTLE_ENDIAN_BITFIELD` is
issued when compiling on big endian systems.

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2444[Bug 2444]
The traffic manager cannot be used with two PktIOs simultaneously. That is,
`odp-linux` does not properly support applications that create more than one
TM system. This is a bug in the `odp-linux` implementation that will be
corrected. It is not a limit of the architecture or other ODP implementations.

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2449[Bug 2449]
Packet queue pool causes out-of-bounds accesses. This is closely related
to https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2444[Bug 2444] and reflects that
`odp-linux` does not properly support multiple TM systems. This is scheduled
for correction in the first maintenance update for this ODP implementation.

== OpenDataPlane (1.10.1.0)

=== New Features

==== APIs
ODP v1.10.1.0 is a maintenance release and as such introduces no new APIs or
other changes that might result in application source incompatibility with
v1.10.0.0.

==== Modular Scheduler
The ODP scheduler included as part of the `odp-linux` reference implementation
has been modularized to support a "pluggable" architecture that will permit
the easy introduction of alternate scheduler implementations that permit
both easy experimentation as well as alternate scheduling models that are
tuned to specific application workloads (_i.e.,_ a strict priority scheduler
for latency-sensitive workloads). Included in this release is the just the
foundation and alternate schedulers are expected to be added in future ODP
releases.

=== Packaging

==== Rename of `linux-generic` to `odp-linux`
While the platform name within the ODP git repository remains
`linux-generic`, the package name of this reference implementation has been
changed to `odp-linux` to better reflect that this is an implementation of
ODP that is dependent only on the Linux kernel and is intended to be runnable
on any Linux distribution. All ODP documentation has been changed to reflect
this name change.

=== Helpers

==== Introduction of "agnostic" threading support
The current helper APIs for linux pthreads (`odph_linux_pthread_create()`, etc.)
and processes (`odph_linux_process_fork()`, etc.) have been augmented with a
new "agnostic" set of helper routines for general ODP thread management.

`odph_odpthreads_create()` and `odph_odpthreads_join()` are now the preferred
helpers to use for creating and joining threads that may be implemented as
_either_ pthreads or Linux processes. Although currently ODP threads in
Monarch are assumed to share the same (single) address space, this change is
to permit evolution towards multi-address space (_i.e.,_ process oriented)
threading models without requiring application and/or validation test changes.

The various ODP examples and validation tests that make use of threading have
all been changed to new these new helper APIs.

==== Thread affinity APIs
As part of the new "agnostic" threading support, two additional helper APIs
(`odph_odpthread_getaffinity()` and `odph_odpthread_setaffinity()`) have been
added to permit easy management of thread affinity.

The CUnit framework used by the ODP validation suite has been changed to set
the affinity of the initial thread to the first available control CPU. This
avoids inconsistencies in a number of timing tests.

=== Bug Fixes
As a maintenance release, numerous bugs have been fixed in the `odp-linux`
reference implementation in areas such as platform support (particularly on
32-bit systems), compiler support (clang), C++ compatibility, and other
cleanup items. Highlights include:

==== 32-bit platform support
The `configure` utility now correctly identifies and sets variables needed for
proper compilation on 32-bit x86 systems. In addition the Traffic Manager
now executes properly on 32-bit systems.

==== Timer improvements
The `odp_timer_t` abstract type is now strongly typed for consistency with
other ODP types, and the `odp_timer_to_u64()` and `odp_timer_pool_to_u64()`
APIs are now properly implemented. In addition, an issue with compiling the
timer routines on 32-bit systems using clang was resolved.

==== Scheduler fairness
The default scheduler has been improved to avoid starvation and increase
fairness when running with a limited number of threads or CPUs.

==== 128-bit atomics
The `-mcx16` compiler option is now properly identified and used to support
128-bit atomics on systems that support these operations. This leads to
increased efficiency in the implementation of both timers as well as other
atomic operations.

==== Use of hugepages
In systems that support multiple hugepage sizes, the default hugepage size is
now reported properly by the `odp_sys_huge_page_size()` API.

==== Coverity and Valgrind issue cleanup
Numerous issues identified by the Coverity scan tool have been cleaned up
and resolved, leading to improved robustness in the `odp-linux` reference
implementation. In addition, several memory leaks identified by the valgrind
tool have been fixed.

==== Validation test resource checks
The Traffic Manager validation test has certain sub-tests that require a
minimum of 2 CPUs to operate properly. These tests are now skipped with a
warning when run on uniprocessor systems.

=== Performance
Performance enhancements in the `odp-linux` reference implementation have been
made in packet processing, classification, and pktio, leading to increased
observed throughput and packet handling rates.

=== Examples
A new `l2fwd_simple` example has been added that does simple Layer 2 forwarding.

=== Documentation
==== Switch from AsciiDoc to AsciiDoctor
To get better formatting capabilities and future extensibility the ODP user
documentation system has been switched from http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc] to
http://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoctor]. There are a handful of notable changes as
a result of this. Those submitting documentation patches should be aware of
the following:

* `monospace font` is now indicated by demarking the text with backticks (`)
rather than plus signs (+).

* Callouts are now indicated by C++-style double slash comments (// <1>)
instead of C-style comments (/* <1> */). So, for example writing
-----------------------------------------------
[source,c]
----
...some great code deserving a callout // \<1>
----
<1> This is an example of a callout
-----------------------------------------------
yields:
----
...some great code deserving a callout // <1>
----
<1> This is an example of a callout

Note that this change only affects user documentation. Code documentation
still uses http://doxygen.org[Doxygen].

==== Image Cleanup
The images in the user guide have been trimmed to fit the page better. In
addition, many new images have been added to better illustrate ODP API usage.

==== Additional User Documentation for Monarch APIs
The *ODP User's Guide* has been updated to include new sections documenting
the use of the full Monarch packet APIs as well as the Timer APIs. In
addition, the crypto, classification, and traffic manager API documentation
has been improved to cover all of the latest Monarch features, and an
introductory section on overall ODP packet flow architecture has been added.

==== Helper Documentation
The ODP Helper library now has its own document that describes these additional
functions of use to ODP applications and validation tests.

==== Other documentation
The Process Guide, FAQ, CONTRIBUTING, and CHANGELOG files have been reworked
for the new AsciiDoctor structure, leading to a more uniform method of
presenting ODP support documentation. In addition, an option for generating
both a "pure" ODP API document that defines the APIs in their
implementation-independent forms as well as their implementation-dependent
forms for the `odp-linux` reference implementation is now available.

=== Known Issues
==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2301[Bug 2301]
The scheduler does not remove PKTIN queues following `odp_pktio_close()`

==== https://bugs.linaro.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2309[Bug 2309]
The timer validation tests have seen occasional failures when run on systems
containing a larger number of CPUs (typically 24 or more).

== OpenDataPlane (1.10.0.0)

=== New Features

  queue, shared memory, and traffic manager areas all add new APIs to query
  implementation-specific capability limits for enhanced program portability.

==== Classification
* Addtion of a structure that defines system level classification capability
* Addition of range PMRs to complement the existing value PMRs to permit
  application to specifiy classification rules over a range of values.

  segments or truncated as needed.
* Align an area of packet data (e.g. IP/UDP headers) so that it is contiguous in
  memory and starts in a specified minimum alignment.
* Add packet time stamp metadata support.
* Add packet input index metadata support to allow application context to
  be anchored from the associated interface that received the packet.
* Deprecation and removal of segment-level buffer APIs that are now
  superseded by additional packet-level manipulation APIs discussed above.

==== Packet io
* Replaced config definition for maximum pktio entries with maximum packet IO
  index call
* Added the classify_enable bit to the odp_pktin_queue_param_t that allows
  applications to explicity control which pktin queues are subject to full
  classifier support.
* Addition of pktin configuration options to control packet timestamping
  and checksum validation processing.
* Addition of pktout configuration options to control packet checksum
  offload processing.
* Add the ability to query (via capabilties) whether a pktio interface
  supports operating in loopback mode and if so to enable/disable this
  mode of operation.
* Round out the polling APIs be adding the ability to receive packets in
  poll mode from one or more pktin queues with timeout.
* Add the ability to set the pktio interface index for ease of setting up
  application context areas associated with each pktio.
* Add the ability to inqure the timestamp resolution associated with
  pktio interfaces that support packet timestamping.

==== Queue
* Add a queue capability API to query system-wide queue capabilities and limits.
* Extend queue context with an explicit data length parameter that serves
  as a performance hint for the amount of context to prefetch when the
  scheduler selects an event from a scheduled queue.

==== Scheduler
* Add the ability to query information about a defined scheduler group

==== Shared Memory
* Add a capability inquiry API to obtain implementation shared memory limits.

==== Traffic Manager

  TM queues, and TM nodes for symmetry and completeness to allow applictions
  to terminate gracefully without resource leakage.
* Add the ability to disconnect TM queues from their fanouts.
* Add TM node contexts to permit applications to anchor user context areas
  to TM nodes.
* Add the ability to query info about TM node fanins and TM queues.
* Deprecate and remove the odp_tm_periodic_update() API

==== Utilities/Helpers
* More complete and correct checksum implementation

=== Known Issues

== OpenDataPlane (1.9.0.0)

=== New Features

* A focus has been made on improving the packaging support of ODP for
  distributions such as Debian.
* Improved creation of source tar ball and packaging scenarios moved to
  https://git.linaro.org/lng/odp-packaging.git
* Renamed libodp to libodp-linux
* Removed all internal functions from leaking through the libodp-linux

=== Known Issues

Time and Traffic Manager validation tests sometimes fail on heavy loaded
systems. This behaviour depends on time accuracy measurements, which depends
on system load.
