# ODP specification

ODP specification consists of several types of files, which together provide
full list of types, values and functions that ODP implementation MUST provide.

## API Principles

Both applications and implementations must comply with the API specification. If
not otherwise documented, results are undefined if an application acts against
the specification. For example, if an application passes bad parameters to an
ODP API, one implementation may report an error, while another may not check
them (to maximize performance) and would just crash.

Many ODP component areas provide an odp_xxx_capability() API that returns
platform-specific information regarding supported features in that component.
For best portability applications should always use these capability APIs.

ODP APIs are described using opaque data types of which definition are left up
to the ODP implementation. For example, ODP packets are referenced by handles of
type odp_packet_t, and packet-related APIs take arguments of this type. What an
odp_packet_t actually is, is not part of the ODP API specification and
applications cannot make assumptions about the underlying type.

Application gains ODP handle ownership when it receives it from an ODP API call.
For example, application can receive an odp_event_t handle from `odp_schedule()`
call. The ownership ends when the handle is passed back to ODP, for example with
`odp_queue_enq()` call. Application MUST NOT use the handle anymore after it
has lost the ownership.

Lifetimes of structures passed by reference to ODP API do not need to be
longer than the duration of the API function being called. In other words,
an application can free or reuse such parameter structures as soon as the
API function returns. This principle applies unless otherwise noted.
This principle applies also recursively to all structures referred to by
the parameter structures through pointer fields in the structures, unless
otherwise noted. An ODP implementation must internally copy the content of
any parameters that it needs to retain after an API call. This principle
does not apply to objects referenced through handles.

## API headers

ODP API headers are divided into the following directories.
```
include/
├── odp_api.h
└── odp/
    ├── api/
    │   ├── abi-default/
    │   └── spec/
    └── arch/
        └── @ARCH_ABI@/
            └── odp/
                └── api/
                    └── abi/
platform/
└── @with_platform@/
    ├── include/
    └── include-abi/
        └── odp/
            └── api/
                └── abi/
```

### Application header

This header found at `include/odp_api.h` is an entry point for an application.
Application MUST include only odp_api.h, nothing else. This file includes all
files from ODP specification.

### API specification

These are the files from `include/odp/api/spec` directory. They specify a set
of function prototypes, types, type names, enumerations, etc. that MUST be
provided by ODP implementation. Doxygen comments inside these files document
the API specification. Content of some types and value of some enumerations are
left undefined in API spec. These are defined either in ABI spec or
implementation specific (non-ABI compatible) headers. An implementation MUST use
these headers AS IS, without any modifications to be compatible with ODP
specification.

### ABI compatibility specification

These are the files from `include/odp/arch/@ARCH_ABI@/odp/api/abi/` directory.
They specify a set of types and values that MUST be used AS IS without any
modifications by an implementation if it supports and is compiled for
ABI-compatibility mode.

### Default ABI headers

These are the files from `include/odp/api/abi-default` directory. They provide
default specification for ODP types and values for ABI compatibility. CPU
architecture specific ABI compatibility files heavily depend on these headers.
These files MUST NOT be changed by an implementation.

### Additional API headers

These are the files from `include/odp/api` directory. They glue together API
and ABI specification headers. Although they are not part of ODP specification
itself, they provide an easy way for an implementation to use ODP API/ABI
header files.  An implementation SHOULD use these headers AS IS unless it has
strong reason not to do so.

## Platform-specific headers

### Platform ABI headers

These are the headers found at
`platform/@with_platform@/include-abi/odp/api/abi` directory. They are used by
the rest of ODP code if implementation is compiled with ABI compatibility
disabled. They should implement at least a set of types and values documented
in ODP API specification headers. They are permitted to provide any platform
specific optimizations (i.e. they might provide types and/or values that map
directly onto the hardware details, they might provide inline functions to
speed up execution of the application, etc.). These headers MAY use ODP default
ABI headers if they do fit.

### Additional platform-specific headers

Platform MAY provide additional headers at `platform/@with_platform/include`.
However, these headers SHOULD NOT be used directly by an application, because
this will tie it to the exact implementation details. Application MUST include
only &lt;odp_api.h&gt; header.  Platform ABI headers MAY use these headers to
implement platform-specific optimizations.

:description: This document is intended to guide a new application developer +
in understanding the  contributing requirements for ODP

:numbered!:
[abstract]

== Abstract

This document is intended to guide a new application developer in understanding
the  contributing requirements for ODP

== New Development

ODP code shall be written with the kernel coding style
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/process/coding-style.rst[Kernel Coding Style]

ODP code shall be documented using the doxygen style described in the
"Documenting the code" section.
Check patch script/checkpatch.pl shall be used before submitting a patch.

== ODP patch expectations as an  open source project

While specific to the Linux kernel development, the following reference could
also be considered a general guide for any Open Source development
http://ldn.linuxfoundation.org/book/how-participate-linux-community[Participating in the Community]
and is relevant to ODP. Many of the guidelines in this ODP document are related
to the items in that information.

Pay particular attention to section 5.3 that talks about patch preparation.
The key thing to remember is to break up your changes into logical sections.
Otherwise you run the risk of not being able to even explain the purpose of a
change in the patch headers!
In addition section 5.4 explains the purpose of the Signed-off-by: tag line as
discussed in later parts of this document. Due to the importance of the
Signed-off-by: tag line a copy of the description follows:

Signed-off-by: this is a developer's certification that he or she has
the right to submit the patch for inclusion into the [project].  It is
an agreement to the Developer's Certificate of Origin, the full text of
which can be found in
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst[Submitting Patches]

Code without a proper signoff cannot be merged into the mainline.

== Common Errors in Patch and Commit Messages

- Avoid starting the summary line with a capital letter, unless the component
  being referred to also begins with a capital letter.
- Don't have one huge patch, split your change into logical subparts. It's
  easier to track down problems afterward using tools such as git bisect. It
  also makes it easy for people to cherry-pick changes into things like stable
  branches.
- Don't simply translate your change into English for a commit log. The log
  "Change compare from zero to one" is bad because it describes only the code
  change in the patch; we can see that from reading the patch itself. Let the
  code tell the story of the mechanics of the change (as much as possible), and
  let your comment tell the other details -- i.e. what the problem was, how it
  manifested itself (symptoms), and if necessary, the justification for why the
  fix was done in manner that it was. In other words, the long commit message
  must describe *why* the change was needed (instead of what has changed).
- Don't start your commit log with "This patch..." -- we already know it is a
  patch.
- Don't repeat your short log in the long log. If you really really don't have
  anything new and informational to add in as a long log, then don't put a long
  log at all. This should be uncommon -- i.e. the only acceptable cases for no
  long log would be something like:
  "Documentation/README: Fix spelling mistakes".
- Don't put absolute paths to source files that are specific to your site.
- Always use the most significant ramification of the change in the words of
  your subject/shortlog. For example, don't say "fix compile warning in foo"
  when the compiler warning was really telling us that we were dereferencing
  complete garbage off in the weeds that could in theory cause an OOPS under
  some circumstances. When people are choosing commits for backports to stable
  or distro kernels, the shortlog will be what they use for an initial sorting
  selection. If they see "Fix possible OOPS in...." then these people will look
  closer, whereas they most likely will skip over simple warning fixes.
- Don't put in the full 20 or more lines of a backtrace when really it is just
  the last 5 or so function calls that are relevant to the crash/fix. If the
  entry point, or start of the trace is relevant (i.e. a syscall or similar),
  you can leave that, and then replace a chunk of the intermediate calls in the
  middle with a single [...]
- Don't include timestamps or other unnecessary information, unless they are
  relevant to the situation (i.e. indicating an unacceptable delay in a driver
  initialization etc.)
- Don't use links to temporary resources like pastebin and friends. The commit
  message may be read long after this resource timed out.
- Don't reference mirrors, but instead always reference original authoritative
  sources.
- Avoid punctuation in the short log.

== Documenting

- References to wikipedia are not permitted.

=== Documenting the code

- Allow doxygen to use all its default behaviors to identify tagged
  information but where a doxygen tag must be specified use @
- The first line is by default the brief summary.
- The next paragraph is by default the detailed summary
- Doxygen shall generate the layout, no additional formatting should be inserted
- Normal comment sections should be before the code block and start with
  /** on its own line and finish with */ on its own line. The exception
  to this rule is a case where the comment is very small, for example
[source,doxygen]
----
    /** macro description */
    #define SOME_MACRO 0
----
- Commenting on the end of a line for macros and struct members is allowed
  using:     /**&lt; &lt;text&gt; */ for example
[source,doxygen]
----
    #define SOME_MACRO 0 /**&lt; &lt;text&gt; */
----
- Files should start with a files description using @file
- Functions should specify their parameters with @param[in] and @param[out]
- Functions return values should all be specified using @return or @retval
- There should be no doxygen warnings or errors generated.

=== Documenting the user docs

- Users guides are stored in asciidoctor format in the odp/docs directory and in
  sub directories of it as appropriate.
- ODP code references such as types and enums are highlighted using the
  ` syntax. For example text referring to the type odp_pktio_t would decorate the
  type thus:
[source,asciidoc]
----
        `odp_pktio_t`
----
- Section heading use the = syntax. For example:-
[source,asciidoc]
----
        == Level 1
        Text.

        === Level 2
        Text.
----
- Code and scripting excerpts are decorated with the block syntax:-
[source,asciidoc]
----
        .Optional Title
        [source,perl]
        ----
        &lt;code here&gt;
        ----
----
- Images are decorated with :-
[source,asciidoc]
----
        .Optional Title
        image::../&lt;image name&gt;.svg[align="center"]
----
- The images are stored in the doc/images directory as svg files, src for image
  generators such as .gv and .msg should also render to .svg
- Body text shall wrap at the 80 char point.
- No warnings may be generated by the asciidoctor tool.
