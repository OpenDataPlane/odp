ipsec: {

	# (i.e. anti-replay window update and sequence number generation)
	# is the same as the original packet order.

	# asynchronous IPsec operations. They have no effect on synchronous
	# operations where the ODP application is responsible of the ordering.
	#
	# Values:
	#
	# 0: Ordering is not attempted.
	#
	#    This has the lowest overhead and the greatest parallelism but
	#    is not fully compliant with the API specification.
	#
	#    Lack of ordering means that outbound IPsec packets, although
	#    remaining in the correct order, may have their sequence numbers
	#    assigned out of order. This can cause unexpected packet loss if
	#    the anti-replay window of the receiving end is not large enough
	#    to cover the possible misordering.
	#
	#    Similarly, since anti-replay check is not done in the reception
	#    order, the anti-replay check sees additional packet misordering
	#    on top of the true misordering of the received packets. This
	#    means that a larger anti-replay window may be required to avoid
	#    packet loss.
	#
	# 1: Ordering by waiting
	#
	#    Correct processing order is maintained by a simple mechanism
	#    that makes a thread wait until its scheduling context has
	#    reached the head of its input queue.

	#    This limits parallelism when single input queue is used, even
