# ODP runtime configuration options
#
# This template configuration file (odp-linux-generic.conf) is hardcoded
# during configure/build phase and the values defined here are used if
# optional ODP_CONFIG_FILE is not set. This configuration file MUST
# include all configuration options.
#
# ODP_CONFIG_FILE can be used to override default values and it doesn't
# have to include all available options. The missing options are
# replaced with hardcoded default values.
#
# The options defined here are implementation specific and valid option
# values should be checked from the implementation code.
