How to build:
    See DEPENDENCIES file about system requirements and dependencies to external
    libraries/packages. It contains also some more detailed build instructions.

    ODP requires the -fno-strict-aliasing (or equivalent) compiler option. This
    option is enabled by default in ODP.

    Generally, ODP and test applications are built with these three steps:
        ./bootstrap
        ./configure
        make

    See help on configure options:
        ./configure --help

    ODP header files and libraries can be installed with:
        make install

    ODP API documentation can be built with (requires Doxygen):
        make doxygen-doc

    Validation tests (requires CUnit) and other test applications can be
    executed with:
        make check

    Users guides can be generated with:
        ./bootstrap
        ./configure --enable-user-guides
        make
